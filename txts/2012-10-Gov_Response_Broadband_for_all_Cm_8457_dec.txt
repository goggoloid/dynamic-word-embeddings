Introduction
The Government welcomes the House of Lords Select Committee’s 1st Report of
Session 2012-13.
The Government is grateful to the Committee for its examination of the key issues
relating to the key broadband policies as set out in the ‘Britain’s Superfast Broadband
Future’ based on written and oral evidence from stakeholders. We welcome the
detailed consideration the Committee has given to these issues, and note its
recommendations.
The Government has carefully considered all the recommendations suggested by the
Committee and is pleased to be able to present its response.

4

The Government’s Approach
The Government welcomes this report by their Lordships and acknowledges the
recommendations and themes presented. Before responding in detail to these, we
thought it appropriate to summarise the Government’s current approach and why we
believe this is right way forward.
The Government recognises the economic growth potential of broadband and has
made available £530m to stimulate private investment to take superfast broadband to
90% of UK premises and basic broadband coverage to virtually everyone else at a
speed of at least 2Mbps. It has also allocated a further £150m to support the
development of super-connected cities which will have ultrafast broadband and high
speed wireless internet access. This support, in addition to commercially-led
deployment by the private sector, is aimed at delivering our key ambition of having the
best superfast broadband network in Europe by 2015.
The current Government approach is to support the extension of fibre deeper into the
network, including the transmission network (backhaul/middle mile) where this is a
bottleneck. The Government has sought to encourage infrastructure competition
through providing funding to stimulate private investment in locations where the
commercial investment case is weak and would be unlikely to happen at all without
subsidy.
The Government considered a range of different delivery options prior to embarking on
its current approach, including taking into account the cost and need for delivering
sustainable solutions that do not require continued government subsidy. It considered
that the market was best placed to determine which solutions and network design
could deliver affordable and sustainable services to consumers – with technology
neutrality key.
The Government’s approach is for procurement to take place at a local level, and
through Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK), the Government has worked closely with
local authorities across England to ensure all have local broadband plans that set out
how they will meet the Government’s ambitious coverage targets. Similar plans have
been developed by the Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. This approach leverages local and European funding, and as a result over
£1bn of public funds in total will be invested in delivering broadband to remote and
rural areas, together with significant funding from the commercial sector.
To facilitate the procurement process and to avoid local authorities having to repeat
costly and time consuming procurements, the Government has procured the
Broadband Delivery Framework, enabling local authorities to invite suppliers to bid
under mini-competitions to deliver their local projects. BT and Fujitsu were confirmed
as the chosen suppliers following a rigorous assessment process which ensured that
the suppliers were capable of delivering affordable and sustainable services to
consumers. The Broadband Delivery Framework provides for projects involving a gap
funded investment model. All procurements will be complete by summer 2013, with
deployment starting on the first projects from summer 2012.

5

The Government are supporting the programme of investment with a series of policy
and regulatory interventions that will lower the cost of deployment for commercial
providers and provide greater certainty to allow the market to invest. The Government
recently announced that:
•

broadband street cabinets and other infrastructure (such as overhead
infrastructure) can be installed without the need for prior approval from the
local council (except in Sites of Special Scientific Interest);

•

broadband companies will face less cost and bureaucracy in laying cables
in streets;

•

broadband cables and cabinets can be installed on or under private land
without the bureaucratic burden of long-running negotiations; and

•

Government will broker a new deal for the installation of broadband with
industry and highway authorities to ensure that traffic regulation does not
hinder the roll out of superfast broadband

These measures will tackle issues that are costing communications providers time and
money, delaying the roll out of superfast broadband to the areas that need it most. We
will be bringing forward these measures as soon as possible, following consultation
where necessary.
We believe that this approach of both supporting investment and implementing policy
and regulatory interventions will enable the commercial market to deploy superfast
broadband to as many households as is commercially viable, as well as providing
support in areas where the commercial investment case is challenging. By enabling
local authorities to take control of investments in their area, we maximise public and
private investment whilst ensuring local needs are taken into consideration.

6

The Government’s Response to the
Recommendations
The Government welcomes the Committee’s detailed recommendations, and is
pleased to be able to respond to them – either individually or grouped according to a
broad theme. We believe that the approach we have taken is the most appropriate
way to meet our goal of having the best superfast broadband network in Europe by
2015, and ensure that 90% of households have access to superfast broadband with
the remainder receiving at least 2Mbps. Our responses to the recommendations
reflect this and demonstrate why we believe we are on the right path.
Recommendation
253. We recommend that the Government consider our vision for the UK’s
broadband infrastructure as set out in this report. As a first step, we recommend
that the Government undertake to produce detailed costings of our proposal,
not least because our proposal removes the final mile—the most expensive per
capita component of the network—from the costs requiring public subsidy.
(Para 53)
The Government thanks the Committee for the suggestion of a focus on digital hubs.
This is something that was considered during the course of the detailed work
undertaken by BDUK, and is something that is still being considered for certain
projects, depending on the need and viability. Our plans will deliver fibre deeper into
the network and it will be down to individual procurement processes undertaken by
Local Authorities to determine how best to connect homes from that point onwards –
for example whether through an existing copper connection in the case of fibre to the
cabinet solutions, fibre to the premise solutions, or a fixed wireless solution. The
procurement process will determine which is the most suitable, and as importantly,
affordable, with sustainable service provision without the need for further on-going
subsidy.
Regarding the recommendation to undertake a detailed cost study of the proposal, the
Government does not believe that it should deviate from the current course of action,
so any costings of an alternative proposal would not be helpful at this point. It is also
likely that their Lordship’s proposal would cost far in excess of the funds available to
Government at this point – analysis by consultancy Analysys Mason1 following the
publication of the report estimated that delivery of digital hubs as outlined in the report
would cost more than is currently available, concluding that:
“The major challenge faced by the House of Lords proposals is that they appear to
require substantially more public funding than is currently available.”

1

http://www.analysysmason.com/About-Us/News/Press-releases1/UK-fibre-optic-hubs-PRJul2012/?bp=%252fNews%252f

7

“As the report notes, the amount of government funding allocated to broadband
schemes totals £750m — less than our estimated cost for building hubs in the most
rural 10 percent of the UK. If the hubs were expected to provide greater population
coverage (perhaps as much as the final 33% of the UK population), then the shortfall
would be even greater.”
Recommendation
254. We endorse the European Commission’s suggestion that open access to
dark fibre at the cabinet-level should be introduced as a condition of BDUK’s
umbrella state aid permission. (Para 59)
The Government is content with the position on access to infrastructure set out in the
Commission’s guidelines on State aid for broadband2 that the access requirements
placed on suppliers in receipt of State aid should serve to promote effective and
sustainable competition. The guidelines recognise that ‘open access’ to supplierinstalled dark fibre in the access network provides one route, but not the only route, to
enabling passive access. Rather, the Commission recognises the need to balance the
costs of competition with other access products (e.g. physical infrastructure access
offers a mechanism whereby a supplier can invest in its own infrastructure, deploying
and re-selling its dark fibre deployment). Key is that the stipulated access products
offer a realistic chance of promoting effective and sustainable competition.
255. Accordingly, not least, in order to expedite its own programme, we
recommend that the Government incorporate open access to dark fibre
voluntarily as a feature of its Framework agreement with suppliers. (Para 60)
The Government has addressed this in the Broadband Delivery Framework contract
that requires a supplier to offer either physical infrastructure access (which allows a
competing infrastructure provider to install their own fibre connectivity and to offer
wholesale access to it) or the provision of dark fibre (installation of fibre by the supplier
and to wholesale its provision). Furthermore, the intended evaluation approach for
each of the local authority procurements also requires that a positive weighting is
applied to those suppliers offering both a passive infrastructure access product and a
dark fibre product. There is therefore an incentive for suppliers to consider, on a
voluntary basis, the provision of a dark fibre product.
In addition to this, the network access conditions that apply to the winning supplier
require that supplier to meet all reasonable requests for new forms of network access
i.e. network access requests made during the contract term. Therefore, a supplier is
required to meet a reasonable request that a communications provider might make for
access to its installed dark fibre.
Rather than expediting BDUK’s programme, mandating the provision of dark fibre is
likely to impede progress. BDUK has sought to ensure the right balance is struck
between competition and value for money. The Government does not therefore
2

http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/specific_rules.html#broadband

8

anticipate that the Commission will mandate dark fibre as a specified access product.
Placing that additional requirement (in addition to a passive infrastructure access
product) on suppliers would be likely to significantly increase the cost of delivery with
no clearly identified additional competitive benefit.

256. More broadly, we endorse and invite the Government’s view on the
European Commission’s conclusion on the broadband investment environment
that: “securing truly equivalent access by alternative operators to incumbent
networks is probably the most important guarantee of sustainable competition,
on existing and new networks.” (Para 61)
The Government supports Vice President Kroes’ view that key regulated access and
interconnection products must support equality of access for all companies. This is a
key feature of BT’s 2005 Undertakings3 that functionally separated BT Openreach
(BT’s infrastructure division) from BT’s retail divisions (such as BT Retail) and ensured
that all companies can access certain aspects of BT’s network on the same terms that
BT Retail can. Ofcom can also impose non-discrimination remedies on BT that require
equivalence of access if BT has been found to hold Significant Market Power (SMP)
following market review.
The Government is content that the remedies that Ofcom imposes (such as those in
the local loop unbundling market or the recent physical infrastructure access
requirements), in both instances, are considered to be proportionate and targeted at
ensuring the development of effective and sustainable competition.
Recommendation
257. Broadband policy should begin from the question: what should the UK
communications infrastructure look like? (Para 75)
The Government believes that the UK’s communications infrastructure should have
good coverage across the UK, and offer consumers the choice of providers and price
competition in all markets. We believe this has been achieved, both in the fixed line
and mobile sectors. The plans to deliver superfast broadband to 90% of the UK and at
least 2Mbps for the rest, alongside the 4G coverage commitments, combined with
effective regulation will ensure that this continues.
258. In addition, it should be a fundamental principle of broadband policy that
whatever measures are undertaken to enhance or extend its availability, they
strive to bring about equality of opportunity to access broadband across all
communities in the UK. (Para 76)

Undertakings given to Ofcom by BT pursuant to the Enterprise Act 2002 [Consolidated
version of the Undertakings (covering all variations up to and including variation number 22),
dates 23 March 2010], at

9

259. In this sense, Government policy on broadband should be driven, above all,
by the social benefits it can unleash, and the need to arrest and ultimately
reduce a damaging digital divide. (Para 77)
The Government agrees with the Committee that social benefits should be one of the
key drivers for our broadband policies, but would also emphasise the potential of
broadband to support economic growth. That is why we have put into place a
programme that will deliver superfast broadband of at least 24Mbps to at least 90% of
households, with the remainder able to receive 2Mbps basic broadband – which is
sufficient to allow consumers to utilise internet-based services such as the BBC
iPlayer. As the Lords recognise, it is the final 10% that is particularly challenging, with
very significantly higher costs per premise.
Recommendation
260. We recommend that future broadband policy should not be built around
precise speed targets end-users can expect to receive in the short-term,
however attractive these may be for sloganeers. (Para 110)
Current policy is not built around precise speed targets. We have defined superfast
broadband as a speed greater than 24 Mbps, in line with the definition adopted by
Ofcom in a 2010 report and the BDUK Programme Delivery Model4. That speed
represented the limit of what was deliverable over copper lines using ADSL2
technology. Superfast broadband therefore represents a step change in terms of
capability compared to what was generally available to consumers in 2010. As noted
above, the minimum target speed of 2 Mbps for those we will not be able to reach with
superfast broadband by 2015 is also based on the delivery of a basic capability rather
than a focus on a specific speed.
As the Government set out in the strategy document “Britain’s Superfast Broadband
Future” in December 2010, we will be using a number of indicators to determine
whether the UK meets our ambitions of having the best superfast broadband network
in Europe by 2015. This does includes speed – both upload and download. We do
believe this is an important factor – not because it is attractive for sloganeers, but
because it has a definite impact on how consumers use the internet and is something
that consumers identify with and can measure easily. We believe that it is such an
important factor that in August 2012, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport set out ambitions for the UK to have the fastest network of the larger European
countries by 2015. This is because history has shown us that speed is never enough
and we should not be complacent.
However, as the strategy document recognises, speed is not the only factor. Choice,
coverage and price are also essential – it is important that consumers can access as
good speeds as possible, through as many providers as possible, at a price that is
affordable. The UK has one of the most competitive broadband markets in the world
4

http://www.culture.gov.uk/publications/8482.aspx

10

and we believe it is essential this continues. Ofcom are due to publish the first
European scorecard by the end of the year.
Recommendation
261. In addition, broadband infrastructure policy should be driven by an
avowedly long-term, but also flexible view of the infrastructure’s future. (Para
111)
262. As an overriding principle, we recommend that Government strategy and
investment in broadband infrastructure should always be based on a minimum
ten year horizon and possibly beyond. (Para 112)
263. While we acknowledge the presently elusive nature of a ‘killer app,’ we
believe there is a clear need for the Government to state in explicit terms a longterm vision for a pervasive, robust and resilient broadband infrastructure,
central to national policy and infrastructure planning.
(Para 113)
264. We anticipate and recommend that policy should be ultimately directed
towards universal, point-to-point FTTP as this is a technology not only able to
accommodate current demand, but at current rates of growth, will be able to
accommodate the UK’s bandwidth demands for many decades to come.
(Para 114)
265. In this sense, we recommend that the Government should set out an even
bolder vision for broadband policy than is currently the case. (Para 115)
We support the Committee’s view that policy and investment should focus on the
longer term, and we believe that our current policies and investment programmes do
this. However, technology moves fast and it is not for Government to determine the
technology used to deliver greater speeds and reliability. The market is much more
adept at ensuring access continues to be affordable whilst delivering the speeds and
bandwidths we all want to see. Government’s role is to provide the right environment
for investment to take place, and provide appropriate support in areas where the
commercial case is challenging.
The Government is committed to enabling and encouraging the private sector to
deploy new network infrastructure as quickly and efficiently as possible. That is why a
package of support measures was announced on 7 September aimed at removing or
reducing barriers to deployment of network infrastructure by communications
providers.
Recommendation
266. Given the impossibility, with current constraints on resources, of rolling out
universal point-to-point FTTP, we recommend that Government policy should,

11

as an intermediate step, aim to bring national fibre-optical connectivity—which
would include, as a minimum, fully open access fibre backhaul—within the
reach of every community. This will provide the platform from which basic levels
of service can be provided to all, and an improved service where there is
sufficient demand. (Para 116)
267. As a point of principle, we believe it is incumbent on the Government to
ensure that policy and regulation in the interim guarantee that there is a clear
path from any intermediate steps which may be taken to the roll-out of pointtopoint FTTP and that, crucially, these steps will not serve to hinder or hold back
any future upgrade. (Para 117)
It is not for Government to decide which technology is the most suitable, as it is likely
that a mix of technologies will be needed in the UK, given the topography and
commercial challenges faced in the more rural and remote areas of the UK.
As the Committee recognises, delivering universal point to point Fibre to the Premise
would be extremely costly – estimated at in excess of £25bn. We believe the
investment programmes being delivered by the market in the more attractive areas of
the country for investment will provide consumers with the access they desire, with a
choice of providers at an affordable price. Ofcom, as the National Regulatory
Authority, has a duty to ensure effective competition in the market and we believe they
are meeting this obligation fully. In those areas where subsidy is needed, we expect
those networks built using public funds to provide wholesale access to other operators
in full accordance with European State Aid rules.
Recommendation
268. It should be a fundamental principle of broadband policy that measures be
undertaken, where possible, to reinforce the robustness and resilience of the
network as a whole. (Para 124)
The Government supports the Committee’s view and believes that its policies strike
the right balance. The telecommunications sector is very resilient and is characterised
by excellent Government and industry cooperation via the Electronic Communications
- Resilience and Response Group (EC-RRG), the industry group for which the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) provides the secretariat function.
The group works to share best practice and to improve existing sector resilience
further. The EC-RRG is acknowledged as an excellent example of cooperative
working and leads on maintaining resilience within the telecoms sector which is
considered to be one of the most robust sectors of the Critical National Infrastructure.
EC-RRG has representatives from all of the major telecoms providers as well as the
Regulator.
The EC-RRG manages the Telecoms Emergency Plan which sets out management
processes for handling emergencies, priority customers and priority services (and is
regularly exercised). EC-RRG is made up of Category 2 responders (under the Civil
Contingencies Act 2004) as well as others who participate voluntarily. Each individual
operator has their own plans for how to manage an emergency affecting their systems,

12

as well as plans to restore service to their customers, and will action these when
necessary.
Specific requirements under the European Electronic Communications Framework
Directive, designed to enhance the security and resilience of communications
networks and services and minimise disruption to them, have been in place since May
2011. Measures include increased requirements on providers to ensure the security
and resilience of their networks and services. The requirements are wide ranging and
aim to develop a high level of security and resilience in the Communications sector, as
well as increased transparency on measures taken to achieve this. Requirements
have also been placed on companies to report any significant incidents to the
Regulator (Ofcom), and undergo a security audit in the event of any clear evidence
that companies are not compliant with the Directive.
The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 provides the backdrop for work on enhancing
resilience.
Currently certain communications providers are required to share
information on resilience (as part of their role as Category 2 responders), which they
do through the EC-RRG – though this group actually goes wider and includes
volunteers from the wider communications service provider community who are not
legally required to share information.
The Digital Economy Act 2010 addresses key issues that needed to be progressed to
make the UK a world leader in the supply and use of digital networks and technologies
and acknowledged the importance of existing work on resilience and security. The Act
sets out proposals that allow Ofcom to assess the delivery of communications services
in the face of problems that are realistically likely to be faced and makes the promotion
of investment in communications infrastructure one of Ofcom’s principal duties. In
addition, Ofcom has an obligation to write every three years to the Secretary of State
giving a full assessment of the UK’s communications infrastructure, including its
resilience. The first of these reports was produced in October 2011.
Recommendation
269. We recommend the Government ensure freedom and economy of passage
for communication of data across the UK. (Para 125)
The Government is committed to making broadband access as widely available as
possible and we have reiterated our commitments in that area already in this
response. In addition the Government has worked with industry to develop an Open
Internet Code of Practice which commits signatory ISPs to full and open internet
access products and confirms that traffic management practices will not be used to
target and degrade the services of a competitor.
Recommendation
270. We recommend that Ofcom, in addition to its duties on competition and
investment, be given an additional duty to monitor and foster the efficient
utilisation of existing capacity (including, for example, use of the
communications infrastructure owned by other infrastructure providers) to

13

provide a robust and resilient national network that promotes affordable open
access to wholesale and retail connectivity across the UK. (Para 126)
The Government believes that Ofcom’s existing duties and powers are sufficient to
ensure that there are competitive retail and wholesale broadband access markets
operating in the UK. Ofcom conducts periodic market reviews and implements
remedies as and when they are required to promote competition and investment, a
notable recent example being the decision to open up BT’s network of ducts and poles
to competitors.
The intention of this remedy is to deliver greater infrastructure competition and
competitors are now able to deploy their own equipment using BT’s existing network,
at a regulated price. These products are still in their relative infancy but the
expectation is that consumers will be able to benefit from competitors able to control
their costs by deploying competing networks using BT’s ducts and poles and pass this
saving to consumers, rather than needing to invest the significant sums needed to
build brand new networks, which incur large civil engineering costs.
Ofcom also publishes an infrastructure report providing extensive information on the
availability of communications networks in the UK. The first report was published in
2011 with the second report expected before the end of the year.
Recommendation
271. We recommend that the Government’s targets should refer to minimum and
median levels of service, and that Ofcom adapts its scorecard accordingly. (Para
132)
Whilst the Government recognises that headline speed is not always an accurate
indicator for the speeds received, due to other issues such as contention, interference
and home wiring issues, we believe headline speed offers consumers an indication of
the speed that will typically be received. It is also not always possible to assess
minimum or median speeds without expensive monitoring equipment in every home.
We believe it is also important to provide consumers with as accurate information as
possible at the point of sale so they can make an informed choice about whether or
not to subscribe to a service. Ofcom’s broadband code of practice regarding speeds
ensures this, and enables consumers to differentiate on service provision.
Recommendation
272. In order to ensure the digital divide is not widened, we recommend that the
Government commit to reducing the digital divide between the minimal service
levels guaranteed to all and the median service levels enjoyed by the majority.
(Para 134)
The Government is committed to reducing the digital divide, which is why we have put
in place a detailed plan of action that will deliver superfast broadband to 90% of
households, and at least 2Mbps to the rest.

14

Additionally, the Rural Community Broadband Fund is aimed at supporting superfast
broadband projects in the most rural and remote areas of England, in the final 10%
that will not be reached by the BDUK programme.
Recommendation
273. It is our view that a Universal Service Obligation (USO) is not an appropriate
way to bring about universal access to minimum levels of service, not least
because in practice, imposing legal obligations on ISPs could easily and quickly
lead to drawn out proceedings in the courts. (Para 136)
Recommendation
274. We do, therefore, endorse the approach adopted by the Government:
pledging a Universal Service Commitment, to which it will be politically
accountable, and stating explicitly a clear political aspiration to provide
universal access to a minimum level of broadband provision. This, in our view,
is at this stage a more appropriate approach than introducing a legally binding
USO. (Para 137)
We are pleased that the Committee recognises that a broadband USO would not
deliver universal coverage in a timely or proportionate fashion, and that the
Government’s proposed approach to make available at least 2Mbps to virtually every
household is appropriate.
Recommendation
275. We recommend that the Government, Ofcom and the industry begin to
consider the desirability of the transfer of terrestrial broadcast content from
spectrum to the internet and the consequent switching off of broadcast
transmission over spectrum, and in particular what the consequences of this
might be and how we ought to begin to prepare. (Para 141)
276. While we do not support the introduction of a USO at present, we do believe
that broadcast media will increasingly come to be delivered via the internet. As
and when that happens, and particularly in circumstances where this applies to
PSB channels, the argument for recommending a USO becomes stronger. The
Government should begin now to give this active consideration. (Para 143)
The Government believes that it would be premature to consider such a move at this
time, as it will be some time before an appropriate level of broadband coverage and
access matches that available for Digital Terrestrial Television, as the Committee has
identified. The Government recognises that there is an increasing number of
television services delivered over the internet, but believes consumers should have the
choice to decide how best to view and consume content.

15

Recommendation
277. We bring to the Government’s attention the fact that we have heard a
number of calls during this inquiry, with which we agree, for uptake and
effective use of the internet to become a higher priority. (Para 150)
The Government agrees with the Committee that take up and effective use of the
internet is vital. As the Committee will be aware, Martha Lane Fox, as the
Government’s Digital Champion has been instrumental in driving forward take up,
through Race Online 2012. These campaigns have led to 2m more people accessing
the internet for the first time over the last few years. Go-ON:UK, the successor to Race
Online, is currently planning how to build on this success and is expected to make a
formal announcement of its strategy in early November.
Recommendation
278. We urge the Government to provide a more coherent mechanism for the
provision of enhanced broadband infrastructure in the final 10% than currently
is the case with the Rural Community Broadband Fund. In particular, a new
mechanism for distributing funds must meet the criticism that its predecessor
was flawed in assuming all communities have the capital required, up front, to
invest in their own access network. (Para 160)
We note the Committee’s comments on the Rural Community Broadband Fund, jointly
financed by BDUK and Defra and operated by Defra through the Rural Development
Programme for England. The Fund is specifically designed to extend superfast
broadband into the final 10% or so hard to reach rural communities that will otherwise
only receive standard broadband under the BDUK rural broadband programme (to
ensure that they are not disadvantaged). It is therefore only available to support
technologies that deliver superfast speeds in these 10% areas, to avoid duplication of
public funding.
The Committee raised particular concern over the ability of communities to pay for
project costs upfront. Under the Fund, applicants will need to contribute 50% of funds
from private sources towards the overall costs and show that they have cash available
to meet any ongoing costs. It is an EU requirement that approved grant funds are
claimed back after the expenditure has been incurred. Grant can be claimed in stages
as costs are incurred.
We recognise that the requirement for communities to raise 50% of the project costs
themselves through private investment will be challenging for some applicants.
However, it is a competitive fund and we want to ensure that the available public funds
can help as many communities as possible. During consideration of expressions of
interest under the first round, we considered whether the ability to raise private finance
was causing applicants any difficulties. However, there was no evidence that
applicants were finding this to be a barrier and there has been considerable interest in
the Fund so far within the existing criteria, with over 80 Expression of Interest
applications. In practice, a mix of sources are being identified in applications, from the

16

raising of community shares, charitable funds and contributions from potential
procured providers. Recognising the difficulties in raising private finance, the
Government has provided a fact sheet on ‘Raising Private Finance’ which is available
to all applicants under the Fund.
The Government considers the mechanisms under the existing Rural Community
Broadband Fund to be workable.
Recommendation
279. In their deliberations over the potential reform of the Electronic
Communications Code, we encourage the Law Commission to consider the
impact of the Code on the roll-out and availability of broadband infrastructure
throughout the UK. (Para 167)
One of the reasons the Law Commission were invited to undertake an independent
review of the Code was because of the importance of electronic communications to
the UK’s economy and the social benefits of widening access to modern
communications technology. Their current consultation which closes at the end of
October, references this.
The Law Commission will be making their recommendations to Government in
February 2013, and the Government intends to bring forward the reform of the Code to
produce a wayleave regime which is more transparent, timely and cost effective for
operators and landowners alike, and will better support broadband roll-out.
Recommendation
280. We urge the Government to consider reform of street works permissions
and the current planning system, given their wider impact on the pace and sheer
viability of the roll-out of broadband infrastructure throughout the UK. (Para 168)
The Government has been informed that some communications providers have
concerns about potential delay and cost from the planning system and from street
work permit schemes.
As a result, we recently announced a package of measures which included plans to
streamline the planning process for broadband, including allowing broadband street
cabinets and other infrastructure (such as overhead infrastructure) to be installed
without the need for prior approval from the local council (except in Sites of Special
Scientific Interest).
We will also work with industry and highway authorities to ensure that traffic regulation
does not hinder the roll out of superfast broadband, insist that any new street works
permit schemes approved between now and 2015 are focussed on the most traffic
sensitive streets, and we will review permit schemes to streamline processes and

17

shorten the timescales for the approval of works. Any measures will only take effect in
England, as this is a devolved issue.
Recommendation
281. We recommend that the Government require that all new building
developments be ducted for fibre, with appropriate provision for an internet
connection, and that building regulations for this be developed perhaps
analogous to those which already require adequate provision, for example, for
the delivery of mains electricity and sewage connections. (Para 170)
The Government already has in place ducting guidelines for developers to consider
when building new developments. To supplement this, in December 2010, the
Government published a Publicly Available Specification (PAS) for Next Generation
Access in New Build Homes, which acts as best practice guidelines for developers,
and provides developers with the information they need to future proof their homes.
The Specification is one stage before a full British Standard, and produced in
association with the Building Research Establishment and the British Standards
Institution, we believe this is a more appropriate route to ensuring all new build homes
are equipped to make the most of superfast broadband, rather than requiring
developers to meet a certain level of connectivity as part of building regulations.
Recommendation
282. The refusal to provide financial support for a project, like that in the
Northern Fells, on the grounds that its proposal to use a technology (in this case
white space spectrum) which would not meet the Government’s speed targets,
is a further illustration of the way in which such targets are actually counterproductive. We urge the Government to reconsider using speed targets to define
the goals of their broadband policy. This would allow them to be more flexible
with regard to the technologies used to provide enhanced connectivity,
particularly to outlying communities. Loosening the reins a little could very
quickly have the effect of bringing enhanced broadband capacity to the final
10%. (Para 177)
Any such project using public funding will be subject to constraints set out in the
Commission’s State aid guidelines for broadband that require solutions to provide a
significant step change in capability. The UK’s State aid umbrella scheme will provide
flexibility to subsidise technologies other than FTTP and FTTC (such as fixed wireless)
in recognition of their role as an interim solution when the economics do not yet
support FTTP. These would need to first meet a set of minimum requirements
regarding current capability (including speed) and upgrade path.
Recommendation
283. The alternative strategy we have put forward would avert the situation
which has arisen under the current policy whereby communities are left

18

stranded with a minimal service because a viable enhancement falls below the—
relatively arbitrary—mark set for public funding. We invite the Government to
respond to our proposal that bringing open access fibre-optic hubs within the
reach of every community would liberate communities and enterprises to
evaluate the cost—benefit calculation themselves of the various different
technological solutions available in the access network. (Para 178)
The Government’s target is to successfully ensure superfast broadband is available to
90% of UK premises and basic broadband coverage to virtually everyone else at a
speed of at least 2Mbps. Communities will continue to have the option of developing
their own superfast connections if they so wish, and the deployment of superfast
broadband to 90% of the country will bring all communities nearer to a fibre connection
and reduce the cost to operators to serve them.
Recommendation
284. It should be a fundamental ‘design principle’ of the Mobile Infrastructure
Project that where mobile coverage is being widened for the purpose of
eliminating voice not-spots, coverage for data is widened and enhanced at the
same time. (Para 182)
The Mobile Infrastructure Project is intended to improve mobile phone coverage, whilst
ensuring technical solutions are compatible with future developments such as 4G.
Recommendation
285. The Government should consider the potential for serviced sites
constructed as part of the MIP to be used as open access fibre-optic hubs more
generally, from which independent third parties could extend out their own
alternative, local access networks. (Para 186)
The locations of MIP serviced sites, as well as the backhaul solutions for individual
sites, will be decided on a site by site basis in concert with the MIP Supplier and the
MNOs, on the basis of best value for money and best meeting the MIP requirements.
This could mean sites with either microwave or fibre-optic connections. In order to
maximise the benefits of the MIP, the intention is to allow the sites to be available for
additional uses, provided that those additional uses do not interfere with the main aim
of improving mobile coverage.
Recommendation
286. As suggested in Chapter 3, the danger that results from the lack of
competitive pressure in the construction of the UK’s broadband infrastructure
lies in the fact that the Government can easily find itself in thrall to the
commercial interests of private enterprise, and therefore unable to direct
broadband infrastructure in the wider interests of the UK. (Para 194)
287. We urge the Government, therefore, to recognise as a general principle that
it will be vital to monitor the dominant, national providers vigilantly and to

19

deploy appropriate incentives to ensure they, and the market in which they
operate, behave in the public interest as this will not necessarily follow
automatically from competitive pressures alone. (Para 195)
The UK Government has assigned a set of key responsibilities and duties to the
national regulator and competition authority for communications matters, Ofcom, under
the Communications Act.
Ofcom has a range of formal powers to seek information from industry participants to
allow it to take measured and proportionate action where it considers it appropriate to
meeting its objectives. We consider that the responsibilities and associated powers
that we assign to the independent regulator are likely to deliver the best outcomes for
consumers and citizens in the UK.
The Government believes that this current regulatory regime is appropriate to ensure
competition in the broadband market. The UK has one of the most competitive
markets in Europe, with consumers able to experience excellent choice, service and
price competition. This has been achieved with appropriate and proportionate
regulation, established by carrying out market reviews. The interventions made by
Ofcom have led to a number of innovations which have led to more investment in
broadband, better choice and price competition for consumers. This has been most
evident in the local loop unbundling (LLU) market, but also more recently in the
Physical Infrastructure Access (PIA) requirement, which aims to reduce the barriers to
deployment by enabling access to BT Openreach’s network of ducts and poles.
It is a matter for Ofcom to determine whether the right regulatory framework is in place
as we move towards greater superfast broadband, to ensure competition for
consumers and businesses. BT’s wholesale Generic Ethernet Access product is
slowly being taken up by other providers such as Sky and Talk Talk and it will be for
Ofcom to determine if this should be subject to price controls, as is currently the case
for wholesale access for current generation broadband.
Recommendation
288. In addition, we note the argument of Chapter 3, that despite the presently
non-competitive nature of much infrastructure provision in the UK, open access
to existing connectivity can enable competition to play a role in extending the
reach, connectivity and diversity, and hence also the resilience and
performance, of these networks. (Para 196)
The European Commission’s state aid broadband guidelines set out a framework for
assessing interventions where there are proposals to correct identified failures (and
related common interest objectives) in the provision of superfast broadband (or Next
Generation Access (NGA) as termed by the Commission).
The Government believes it is important to ensure that where the economic
assessment identifies failures in specific markets then the ‘remedies’ adopted only
seek to address those identified markets alone. For example, where a market failure

20

has been identified in the provision of superfast broadband then the central role of
State aid is to ensure that infrastructure is deployed and that in doing so the wholesale
access conditions prescribed deliver genuine competition.
In particular, in considering full ‘open access’ conditions, it is key that the requirements
imposed (a) have the primary objective of delivering the identified failure e.g. NGA
infrastructure; and (b) balance the costs of access against value for money in the
deployment (i.e. ensure that effective and sustainable access measures are specified
in the contract and also provide a clear and ‘open’ route to alternative network access
products should the market need them).
We consider it crucial to ensure consistency and coherence across State interventions
(State aid and ex ante regulation) and taking that approach presents the greatest
opportunity for effective and sustainable competition to develop. We think that this is
the right approach rather than diverting commercial effort into exploiting arbitrage
opportunities introduced by poorly designed and conflicting interventions.
Recommendation
289. We recommend that the Government’s approach be explicit in its insistence
that the technologies and infrastructures in which companies using public funds
decide to invest be ones which offer a clear ‘upgrade path’ to point-to-point
FTTP. (Para 200)
The BDUK sponsored rural rollout will result in optical fibre based solutions being
delivered deep into rural areas, many of which will be FTTP from day 1. It is expected
that facilities (breakout boxes) will be also be provided so the fibre paths can be
extended further as and when communities demand the additional throughput and can
assist in the costs of the final drop.
Recommendation
290. Where infrastructure providers using public money decide to invest in
Passive Optical Networks, we recommend that the awarding of public money
should be contingent on the installation of the splitter at the level of the local
exchange rather than the cabinet, as this would enable passive unbundling, and
thereby real competition between ISPs. (Para 202)
The Government does not believe this suggestion would be feasible. With breakout
boxes and open access conditions available it would seem overly restrictive and
limiting to specify an exchange building as the only location for a splitter. As the
migration to FTTP begins, the reliance on the local exchange will be reduced.
Recommendation
291. We recommend that Ofcom draw on one of the mechanisms at its disposal
to encourage, if not require, the universal adoption of standards like Active Line

21

Access, if not ALA itself, which are open, and industry-led, and contain a
technical specification for the physical network itself, the wholesale products it
should provide, and stipulations regarding the operation, administration and
maintenance (OAM) systems interface between infrastructure providers and
ISPs. The universal adoption of such standards would do much to level the
playing field between alternative infrastructure providers and would help to
stimulate competition at the access network level. (Para 219)
Recommendation
292. We understand Ofcom’s cautious stance with regard to the removal of
restrictions on Physical Infrastructure Access. However, we urge Ofcom to give
the benefits of doing so full consideration. (Para 232)
Recommendation
293. In our view, the benefits of opening up the restrictions on PIA are likely to
be significant, particularly were policy to be re-oriented towards the
establishment of open access fibre-optic hubs, as we advocate. Removing the
restrictions on PIA may, of course, have knock-on effects for the effectiveness
and coherence of other aspects of the overall regulatory edifice. We,
therefore, recommend that Ofcom evaluates alternative approaches to the
regulation of the broadband market as a whole, in line with EU guidelines. (Para
233)
Recommendation
294. In light of the potential benefits, we recommend Ofcom actively considers
the possible implications of putting its Revised EU Framework Directive Article
12 powers to use, by undertaking an Impact Assessment of doing so, including
an open public consultation. Of course, some of Ofcom’s existing remedies in
the broadband markets may be rendered ineffective or incoherent by
implementing these powers. In consulting on their use, therefore, Ofcom should
make positive proposals for how these issues would be overcome. (Para 236)
These are recommendations that are for Ofcom respond to, should they believe it to
be necessary. It would be inappropriate for Government to comment.
Recommendation
Ofcom should consider employing its Article 12 powers to oblige infrastructure
owners to provide open access to dark fibre at the level of the cabinet, and
active and passive access, together with rights to install and co-locate active
equipment on relevant links at the level of the exchanges and other nodes. (Para
243)
This is a recommendation for Ofcom to respond to, should they believe it to be
necessary. It would be inappropriate for Government to comment.

22

Recommendation
296. We urge the industry to work to ensure there is an organisation with the
capacity to act as an intermediary between an array of separate network
providers and larger-scale ISPs. We note that the existence and effectiveness of
such an organisation would be vital to the success of an open access fibreoptic
hub model. (Para 248)
The Government notes the Committee’s recommendation for industry, and is aware
that this is a model that some in the industry have been looking to pursue. We look
forward to developments in this area.
Recommendation
297. The Government should consider, not least in light of the EU Commission’s
current consultation and the issues this raises concerning open access to dark
fibre as a condition of State Aid, what the implications might be for broadband
policy of a new ‘house with a tail’ model emerging in which the property owner
becomes responsible for the construction and maintenance of their own final
drop. (Para 250)
Whilst we recognise that this model has had some success in other European
countries, most notably Sweden and the Netherlands in more urban areas, the
Government does not believe that this model would be appropriate at this time,
particularly given the complexities in accessing appropriate levels of finance in the
housing market. In the more rural and remote areas of the UK, it is likely that the cost
would be prohibitive for most householders. There would also need to be some work
on interoperability and interconnections to ensure there would be sufficient number of
service providers that would be willing to offer services over such a network built in this
way.
Recommendation
298. We recommend that consideration should be given over time by the
Government, Ofcom and the industry as to when and under what conditions
fibre switchover would be appropriate and what implications it would have.
(Para 252)
The Government does not believe that a move towards a fibre switchover at this point
would be useful. The superfast broadband market is still developing and is likely to
consist of a mix of technologies providing services depending on topography in the
short-medium term. It is unlikely that coverage of a fibre only network will have
reached sufficient coverage across the UK in the near future to allow such a
switchover. At such time that this may be a reality, it will be important for Government,
industry and the regulator to work together to consider the implications of such a
move, as the Committee has suggested.
