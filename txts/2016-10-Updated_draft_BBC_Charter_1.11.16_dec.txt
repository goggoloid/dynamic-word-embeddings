6.

The Public Purposes

The Public Purposes of the BBC are as follows.
(1)

To provide impartial news and information to help people understand and
engage with the world around them: the BBC should provide duly accurate and
impartial news, current affairs and factual programming to build people’s understanding
of all parts of the United Kingdom and of the wider world. Its content should be provided
to the highest editorial standards. It should offer a range and depth of analysis and
content not widely available from other United Kingdom news providers, using the
highest calibre presenters and journalists, and championing freedom of expression, so
that all audiences can engage fully with major local, regional, national, United Kingdom
and global issues and participate in the democratic process, at all levels, as active and
informed citizens.

(2)

To support learning for people of all ages: the BBC should help everyone learn
about different subjects in ways they will find accessible, engaging, inspiring and
challenging. The BBC should provide specialist educational content to help support
learning for children and teenagers across the United Kingdom. It should encourage
people to explore new subjects and participate in new activities through partnerships
with educational, sporting and cultural institutions.

(3)

To show the most creative, highest quality and distinctive output and services:
the BBC should provide high-quality output in many different genres and across a range
of services and platforms which sets the standard in the United Kingdom and
internationally. Its services should be distinctive from those provided elsewhere and
should take creative risks, even if not all succeed, in order to develop fresh approaches
and innovative content.

(4)

To reflect, represent and serve the diverse communities of all of the United
Kingdom’s nations and regions and, in doing so, support the creative economy
across the United Kingdom: the BBC should reflect the diversity of the United
Kingdom both in its output and services. In doing so, the BBC should accurately and
authentically represent and portray the lives of the people of the United Kingdom today,

and raise awareness of the different cultures and alternative viewpoints that make up
its society. It should ensure that it provides output and services that meet the needs of
the United Kingdom’s nations, regions and communities. The BBC should bring people
together for shared experiences and help contribute to the social cohesion and
wellbeing of the United Kingdom. In commissioning and delivering output the BBC
should invest in the creative economies of each of the nations and contribute to their
development.
(5)

To reflect the United Kingdom, its culture and values to the world: the BBC should
provide high-quality news coverage to international audiences, firmly based on British
values of accuracy, impartiality, and fairness. Its international services should put the
United Kingdom in a world context, aiding understanding of the United Kingdom as a
whole, including its nations and regions where appropriate. It should ensure that it
produces output and services which will be enjoyed by people in the United Kingdom
and globally.

GENERAL

52.

The BBC’s corporate nature and powers

(1)

The BBC shall have perpetual succession. That is to say, it shall continue to exist as a
legal person, regardless of changes in its composition which occur when particular

individuals cease to be members of the Corporation and are succeeded by other
individuals.
(2)

The BBC shall have a Common Seal. The BBC may alter its Common Seal or replace
it with a new one.

(3)

The BBC shall have the capacity to sue and be sued and do anything appertaining to
a body corporate. In addition, the BBC shall have all the capacity of a natural person.

(4)

Paragraph (3) enables the BBC to maintain, establish or acquire subsidiaries through
which commercial activities may be undertaken.

(5)

Paragraph (3) enables the BBC to do anything incidental or conducive to the carrying
out of their functions.

(6)

However, the BBC may use these general powers only in accordance with articles 4 to
7 (Object, Mission, Public Purposes and activities of the BBC). The use of any of these
powers for other purposes would amount to a breach of this Charter, with all the
consequences that could follow from that (see in particular article 56 (compliance with
Charter and Framework Agreements)). Subject to any overriding rules of law, such a
use of powers shall, nevertheless, be valid: for example, contracts entered into by the
BBC would be valid and enforceable against the BBC for so long as the BBC continues
to exist, to any extent permitted by law.

53.

Framework Agreement

(1)

A “Framework Agreement” is an agreement between the BBC and the Secretary of
State which contains a statement to the effect that it is a Framework Agreement made
for BBC Charter purposes.

(2)

The Secretary of State and the BBC must consult Ofcom on any amendments to a
Framework Agreement relating to the regulation of the BBC by Ofcom.

(3)

In anticipation of the grant of this Charter, the BBC has entered into a Framework
Agreement with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport dated [ ]. Further
Framework Agreements may be made during the life of this Charter (and may amend
or revoke the existing Framework Agreement).

(4)

Framework Agreements may in principle impose obligations on the BBC in relation to
particular topics which are addressed in this Charter, as well as in relation to topics
which are not. A Framework Agreement may, for example, impose more detailed
requirements. For example, article 7(5) (the activities of the BBC) defines non-service
activities which is elaborated in clause 16 of the Agreement made on [ ]. However, a
Framework Agreement must be consistent with this Charter and, in the event of any
contradiction, the terms of this Charter shall prevail. It is hereby declared that the
content of the Framework Agreement as made on [ ] (mentioned in paragraph (3)) is
fully compatible with the intentions of this Charter.

(5)

The BBC must comply with the Framework Agreement, for so long as it is in force (see
article 56 (compliance with Charter and Framework Agreements)).

54.

Overseas concessions
The BBC must obtain the consent of the Foreign Secretary before it—
(a)
acquires any licence, concession, right or privilege from; or

enters into any arrangement with,
the Government of any country or place overseas.

Validity of acts and proceedings

(1)

The existence of a vacancy in any of the bodies mentioned in paragraph (2) does not
as such affect the validity of anything done by that body (though any specific
requirements for a quorum must still be observed).

(2)

The bodies are the Board and any committee or sub-committee of the Board. However,
the Nomination Committee of the Board may exercise a function described in article 31
(committees of the Board) only if fully constituted in accordance with applicable
requirements laid down in that article.

56.

Compliance with Charter and Framework Agreements

(1)

The BBC must strictly and faithfully comply with this Charter and the Framework
Agreement in force. This includes complying with requirements set out in other
documents which have effect by virtue of provisions of this Charter or a Framework
Agreement.

(2)

Where the BBC fails to comply with paragraph (1) of this article in any respect, anyone
who is aggrieved and/or adversely affected may be entitled to seek an appropriate
remedy.

(3)

The BBC must establish a framework for handling and resolving complaints to provide
transparent, accessible, effective, timely and proportionate methods of securing that
the BBC complies with its obligations and that remedies are provided which are
proportionate and related to any alleged non-compliance. Where Ofcom exercise a
function to regulate the BBC, the framework must provide that Ofcom will normally
consider a complaint only after the complaint has been in the first instance resolved by
the BBC.

(4)

Complaints can sometimes also be made to other bodies with regulatory and law
enforcement powers such as the Competition and Markets Authority.

(5)

The courts may have an appropriate role to play in exercising judicial review according
to normal principles of public law.

(6)

This article does not seek to exclude any other remedy which may be available but, so
far as relevant, it is the intention of this Charter that remedies should be appropriate
and proportionate to the issues at stake.

INTERPRETATION

62.

Introduction
To enable this Charter to be drafted in language which is not too cumbersome or
complex, We have relied on various principles or rules of interpretation which are
explained below. These need to be borne in mind when reading the Charter. However,
they need to be used with common sense: they do not apply where the context requires
otherwise. For example, the principle in article 65(2) (gender and number) does not
mean that article 22 (appointment of the Chair of the Board) can be read as enabling
two Chairs to be appointed to serve simultaneously.

References to Orders in Council

Any reference to the doing of anything by Order in Council is a reference to the doing
of that thing by Us, Our Heirs or Successors in Council.
65.

Gender and number

(1)

Words importing the masculine gender include the feminine, and vice versa.

(2)

Words in the singular include the plural. For example, article 55(1) (validity of acts and
proceedings) which refers to “a vacancy”, also applies where there are several
vacancies on the body concerned.

(3)

The following indexation formula is to be used to vary the amounts specified in article
37 (annual report) on 1st June 2022 and 1st June 2026:
(CPIA / CPIB) x 100
Where: CPIA represents the Consumer Price Index all items index figure for the month
before the proposed variation is to be made; and CPIB represents the Consumer Price
Index all items index figure for the month before 1st January 2017.

66.

Continuity of powers and duties
Where this Charter confers a power or imposes a duty it is implied, unless the contrary
intention appears, that the power may be exercised, or the duty is to be performed,
from time to time as occasion requires. For example, the power to change the number
of members of the Board which is conferred by article 21(6) (composition of the Board)
is to be interpreted not just as a “once and for all” power to change the number from
fourteen to another number: it could be used to increase the number, then to reduce,
then return it to fourteen, and so on.

67.

Power to make different provision for different cases
In exercising any function under this Charter, any person may make different provision
for different cases or purposes. For example, the power to determine the pay of nonexecutive members of the Board conferred by article 27(3) (terms on which nonexecutive members of the Board serve) could be used to determine a rate for the Chair
that is higher than the rate determined for other members.

68.

References relate to whatever time is relevant

(1)

Any reference to the holder of any office is to be read as referring to the holder of that
office for the time being i.e. at the relevant time rather than the date on which this
Charter is granted. For example, the power of determination conferred on the Secretary
of State by article 27(3) (terms on which non-executive members of the Board serve)
can be exercised by whoever holds that office at the time such a person wishes to
exercise the power.

(2)

Similarly, references to anything else are to be read as relating to whatever falls within
the reference at whatever time is relevant. For example, the reference in article 17 to
generally accepted principles of good corporate governance should, in the year 2020,
be read as referring to principles of good corporate governance which are generally
accepted in 2020, rather than what was generally accepted when this Charter was
granted.

69.

Implied power to amend
Any power conferred on any person under this Charter to make any document,
however expressed, implies the power, exercisable in the same manner and subject to
the same conditions or limitations, to revoke, amend or re-make any document made
under the power.

70.

References to legislation

(1)

References to particular legislation should be read as referring to that legislation as
amended or re-enacted from time to time.

(2)

In relation to the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands references to any Act are
references to that Act as extended to the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands.

71.

Headings
Headings are for convenience only and are not necessarily a reliable guide to the
precise interpretation of the substantive text to which the heading relates. For example,
to be useful, headings often have to oversimplify, or to be selective in what aspects of
the actual content they flag up.

72.

General declaration
This Charter shall be interpreted objectively. The presumption that a grant by the Crown
is to be interpreted most beneficially for the Crown and against the subject shall not
apply.

IN WITNESS whereof We have caused these Our Letters to be made Patent.
WITNESS Ourself at Westminster the ... day of ... in the sixty-fifth year of Our Reign.

SCHEDULE: TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
1.

Introduction

(1)

No provision of this Charter has effect before the beginning of the Effective Date unless
this Schedule or this Framework Agreement gives it effect (to any extent or for any
purpose) during the Transitional Period. In general terms, this means that the Trust,
the Executive Board, Ofcom and the Audience Councils will continue to exercise their
respective functions under the 2006 Charter and the 2006 Agreement until the Effective
Date. On that date, the Board and Ofcom will start to exercise their respective functions
under this Charter and the Framework Agreement.

(2)

The Effective Date is 3rd April 2017.

(3)

The Secretary of State may, with the agreement of the BBC (Executive Board and the
Trust) and if appointed, the Chair appointed under this Charter and Ofcom, change
the Effective Date.

(4)

In anticipation of the grant of this Charter, the Framework Agreement also contains
transitional provisions which are relevant to that agreement.

Period

During the Transitional Period—

(2)

(a)

the Trust and the Executive Board shall continue to have all the functions
provided for in the 2006 Charter and 2006 Agreement with the 2006 Charter

contrary contained in this Schedule or the Schedule to the Framework
Agreement;

(b)

the Board shall have only the functions contained in, or provided for in, this

The Trust and the Executive Board, respectively, when considering the exercise in
relation to any matter of any of their respective functions during the Transitional Period,

in question on or after the Effective Date.

by virtue of this Schedule and the Schedule to the Framework Agreement shall be
