BBC Charter Review: public consultation

1

Foreword

John Whittingdale
Secretary of State for Culture,
Media and Sport
The BBC is at the very heart of
Britain. It is one of this nation’s
most treasured institutions –
playing a role in almost all of our
lives. The current Royal Charter,
the constitutional basis of the
BBC, is due to expire at the end
of 2016. This paper launches
the Government’s process of
consultation that will inform
our decisions about the future
of the BBC.

2

Last year, as Chair of the Culture, Media
and Sport Select Committee, I heard
evidence from a range of experts about
the BBC on the challenges it has faced and
the issues for its future. This has helped to
establish what this Charter Review needs
to consider. As Secretary of State, I want
to hear from people all over the UK, so I
can understand what this country wants
from and for the BBC.
Ten years ago, the last time the
Government ran a Charter Review, the
media landscape looked very different.
Millions of households still received a
choice of just five television channels.
Facebook was yet to reach the UK,
YouTube was only just being launched
and the iPhone was unheard of. When the
Royal Charter came into force in January
2007 nobody could have predicted quite
how the emerging technologies of the day
would end up shaping the way we use the
media and live our lives, nor the extent to
which some things would stay the same.
The explosion in the use of the internet
and mobile devices mean that people are

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

now spending more time using media
and communicating than sleeping,1 and
are using mobile tablets and smartphones
to stream live and ‘on demand’ video and
audio content at the touch of a button.
Yet this has not meant the ‘death’ of
television or radio – instead we have seen
the range of options increasing – with
new services complementing rather than
usurping the old. Just because lots of
people are using the internet to access
video on demand, to stream music and
to find out the latest news, does not
change the fact that today most people
still want to watch television when it is
broadcast, still rely on radio and still
want to read newspapers.
The BBC has adapted to this changing
landscape. It was asked to lead the way
in the move to digital television, and
has pioneered new services such as
iPlayer, which saw 3.5 billion programme
requests in 2014.2 It has done this while
continuing to provide programmes and
services that we have come to rely on to
inform, educate and entertain. We want
the BBC to continue to adapt and thrive,

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

and to play its part within the wider
Public Service Broadcasting and media
landscape.
The BBC remains much-loved by
audiences, a valuable engine of growth
and an international benchmark for
television, radio, online and journalism.
It has showed this countless times over
the last Charter period: coverage of events
that bring us together like the Olympics;
television that entertains millions like
Miranda, Sherlock and Bake Off or that
educates and informs like the BBC’s
many world-leading nature and history
documentaries; award-winning radio,
with half of adults in the UK listening to
one or more of the BBC’s music stations
each week;3 the UK’s most popular
website; and trusted news coverage that is
relied upon at home and abroad, with the
World Service reaching a global audience
of 210 million and continuing to play an
important role in the way that the UK is
perceived internationally.4 It has done this
while targeting £700 million of annual
savings through Delivering Quality First.5

Executive summary

The constitutional basis of the BBC
is the Royal Charter. This is due
to expire at the end of 2016. This
consultation paper therefore seeks
to engage the UK in a dialogue
about the future of the BBC.

The BBC is one of the great institutions of
Britain. But to continue to thrive it must
continue to evolve. Charter Review will
explore four areas of possible change:
− Mission, Purpose and Values – what
the BBC is for, examining the overall
rationale for the BBC and the case for
reform of its public purposes;
− Scale and scope – what the BBC
therefore should do, examining the
services it should deliver and the
audiences it should be seeking to serve;
− Funding – how the BBC should be paid
for, examining not just future potential
funding models but related issues such
as how best to enforce payment; and
− Governance – how the BBC should be
overseen, examining options for reform
of the current Trust model alongside
other governance issues.

The BBC has changed
considerably over the
nearly 100 years since it
was established. So too
has the world in which it
operates.

Why the BBC?
Mission, purpose and values
The BBC has changed considerably
over the nearly 100 years since it was
established. So too has the world in
which it operates. In the decade since the
current Charter was introduced we have
arguably seen more change in the media
sector than in any previous decade – with
an explosion in choice for audiences
both in terms of the ways of accessing
content and the variety of providers. As
these changes have occurred, some of
the original arguments for the BBC have
become less relevant. But the rationale
for a publicly-funded BBC that “informs,
educates and entertains” as part of a
wider public service broadcasting ecology
remains strong even in the current
media age. The Government is therefore
committed both to the future of the BBC
and to its underlying Reithian mission.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

This changed and changing media
landscape does, however, raise some
questions about how best to define the
unique role of the BBC. One question that
is particularly important is how we can
best understand the idea of ‘universality’.
As more and more options become
available for how audiences watch, read
and listen to content, the question of the
extent to which the BBC should focus
on providing programmes and services
for all audiences, and on an equal basis,
across every platform, or whether it
should instead focus more on particular
or underserved audiences with its output,
becomes relevant. A second question
relates to whether the BBC should instead
have a more targeted or prioritised set of
purposes to reﬂect its increasingly varied
and competitive environment.

7

Executive summary

The BBC currently has six very broad
public purposes, which were set at the last
Charter Review. All of the BBC’s activity
should be working towards one or more
of these:
1. Sustaining citizenship and civil society;
2. Promoting education and learning;
3. Stimulating creativity and cultural
excellence;
4. Representing the UK, its nations, regions
and communities;
5. Bringing the UK to the world and the
world to the UK;
6. Delivering to the public the benefit of
emerging communications technologies
and services.
In Charter Review the Government will
consider the case for reforming these
purposes, to provide greater clarity around
what the BBC is there to achieve. It will
also examine the case for whether the
BBC would benefit from having a clearly
defined set of values, establishing through

8

the Charter a set of unique features of
the BBC including its independence and
impartiality.

What the BBC does.
Scale and scope
The public purposes set the framework
for what the BBC should be seeking to
achieve. Moreover, the Charter states
that the main activities of the BBC should
be providing information, education and
entertainment output through TV, radio
and online services. But the Charter
does not specify how much information,
education and entertainment output
to provide, the numbers and types of
channels and services in which to provide
this, the balance of provision between
information, education and entertainment
provision, or the level of provision to
different audiences – in effect, what
should determine the scale and scope of
the BBC. Whether the present scale and
scope is right for the current and future
media environment, and delivers services
that audiences want and are willing to
pay for, are key questions for this Charter

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Review. This is particularly the case in the
context of digital services – where there
has been most development in the past
decade. Charter Review will consider four
main aspects of scale and scope:
− Range of services. The range of
services that the BBC provides has
increased dramatically over the last two
Charter periods. Twenty years ago the
BBC had just two television channels
and five national radio stations. Now
it is the world’s largest Public Service
Broadcaster, providing nine television
channels, ten national radio stations
with a huge online presence reaching
millions of people every day. Charter
Review is an opportunity to decide
whether this is the right range of
services for licence fee payers, or
whether the public would be better
served by a more focused range of BBC
services. Alongside this, views are sought
on the nature and extent to which the
BBC should be migrating away from
traditional broadcast platforms towards
more of an online presence.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

− Impact on the market. The way these
services affect other organisations in
the media sector is an important factor
when thinking about what services
the BBC is providing and how. The
wider media sectors have grown over
recent decades and the UK boasts
one of the most vibrant media and
creative economies in the world. The
BBC can have both a positive and a
negative impact on the activities of
its competitors. It has arguably helped
the development of the sector by
encouraging high standards and through
investment in independent production
and the infrastructure of media
distribution. However, others make the
case that the level of public funding
gives the BBC an unfair advantage
and distorts audience share in a way
that undermines commercial business
models. The BBC has 60 per cent of
the revenues of the radio sector in the
UK, for example, while its provision
of extensive free online content risks
impacting a wide range of players.

9

Executive summary

− Audiences. The BBC remains highly
valued and well-used by the majority
of people within the UK. But there
are variations across different groups
and there are particular challenges
in reaching black, Asian and minority
ethnic audiences and in meeting the
needs of younger age groups who
increasingly access content online,
rather than via the traditional platforms
of television and radio. There is also
variation across the nations and regions
of the UK. Charter Review will consider
the extent to which the BBC is meeting
the needs of these different segments
of the domestic audience. It will also
examine how international audiences
can best be served, in the context of the
important role the BBC plays in the way
that the UK is perceived internationally
(BBC services now reach more than
300 million people globally each week).

10

− Content mix, quality and
distinctiveness. Charter Review is also
an opportunity to look at the content
the BBC is providing. The BBC has made
changes to its genre mix in recent
years, and consideration needs to be
given to whether it is striking the right
balance in terms of its offer. In terms of
quality and distinctiveness, the BBC’s
own data suggests that perceptions
have remained broadly consistent in
recent years. But in this review we will
ask questions about the quality and
distinctiveness of BBC content and how
success for the BBC is best measured.
The way that the BBC determines how it
spends £2.4 billion on content is another
important element of the scale and scope
of its operations for Charter Review to
consider. The way content is produced
is shaped by two main elements: the
broader regulatory framework including
the Terms of Trade, which set out how
the BBC and other broadcasters work
with independent producers, and the
BBC’s quota systems. The quotas set
minimum amounts of content that must

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

be produced by the BBC itself and by
independent production companies, as
well as setting other requirements such
as ‘out of London’ production. These
elements need to be looked at in the
round to make sure that the BBC is able
to continue to deliver great content to
audiences, efficiently and cost effectively,
while minimising any negative impact on
the wider market and maximising any
benefits. The BBC is developing its own
proposals for a ‘compete and compare’
strategy that would remove quotas and
turn the BBC’s production operations into
a commercial subsidiary. Charter Review
will consider this proposal as well as other
options for reform.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

BBC funding
The licence fee has proven to be a
remarkably resilient source of revenue for
the BBC – providing £3.7 billion of public
funding last year. While it has a number
of strengths as a funding model, it also
faces challenges:
− There are concerns about people being
prosecuted for TV licence evasion,
which is the subject of the recent
independent review by David Perry QC;
− It is a compulsory ﬂat rate which means
those on low incomes pay as much as
those on high incomes;
− It is struggling to keep up with
technology as more people –
particularly the young – are accessing
only catch-up television online, and are
exempt from needing a TV licence as
currently constituted.

11

Executive summary

While there are issues with the licence
fee, there is no easy solution in terms
of reform. One option that could be
considered for the longer term is a
subscription model. While this has some
advantages, the technology that would
be required to introduce it – specifically
access controls – is not yet widely
available in homes. As such, if this option
is considered desirable it would need to be
introduced over a longer period. The three
options for changing the funding model
that are viable in the shorter term are:
− a reformed licence fee;
− a media levy;
− a hybrid licence fee and subscription
model.
All of these bring benefits and costs and
through Charter Review we want to look
at which provides the best model for the
future.

12

The Government has committed to
bringing forward legislation in the next
year to modernise the licence fee in order
to cover Public Service Broadcast catch-up
TV. This is important both to make sure
that the television watching public gets
a fair deal and that the funding of the
BBC remains robust for future decades.
Through Charter Review the question
of how this can be done needs to be
answered so that the Government can
legislate to close this loophole.
A second funding issue relates to
what areas and activities should have
protected funding. Currently there are a
range of projects and areas of work where
it has been agreed with Government that
a level of funding should be protected,
rather than being left entirely to the
discretion of the BBC. This applies to areas
like broadband roll-out, digital switchover,
local TV, the World Service and S4C. The
BBC and Government have already agreed
some aspects of this, but questions

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

remain about whether funding should
be protected in other areas, such as for
digital radio switchover, regional news and
content. There is also an important issue
relating to whether other broadcasters
should be able to access some licence fee
funding to enable them to produce more
public service content than they would
otherwise be able to afford.
Third, when looking at funding it is
important also to assess the value for
money and efﬁciency that the BBC
achieves. There are times over the current
Charter period when this has been called
into question – for example in terms
of big redundancy pay-offs for senior
executives and the failed Digital Media
Initiative which cost £100 million before
it was written off. The BBC is still cheaper
than most pay TV bundles and delivers
a wide range of services, but there are
legitimate questions about whether, and
how, it could do more to deliver the most
value from the licence fee.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

Finally, there is also an important
question for the Charter Review about
how the BBC generates its own income
through commercial activity. Commercial
income currently represents about a
quarter of the BBC’s total income. This is
important in maximising the return on
the investment in content which can then
be reinvested. The majority of the BBC’s
commercial activity is conducted by BBC
Worldwide which, last year, returned over
£200 million to the Corporation. The
balance to be struck is how this return can
be maximised while ensuring BBC output
is driven by its public value rather than
its retail value in international markets.
All options will be considered for how
this can be delivered best.

13

Executive summary

BBC governance and regulation
The last issue, and one that ultimately
underpins all the others, is governance
and regulation. The last Charter
introduced a new model, creating the
BBC Trust. This established a body whose
primary responsibilities are to represent
the licence fee payer’s interests and
to hold the BBC to account on their
behalf. While this made positive changes
including the introduction of new
elements such as Public Value Tests and
Service Licences, this structure has come
under sustained criticism throughout the
Charter period.

14

There is a high level decision about the
structures and organisations that make up
the model of governance and regulation.
There are three broad options:
− keeping the current Trust but
reforming it;
− creating a new standalone regulator and
giving the BBC a unitary board;
− moving regulation wholly to the existing
media and telecoms regulator Ofcom
and giving the BBC a unitary board.
These all have advantages and difficulties
and the success of any model will
lie in exactly where specific roles,
responsibilities and powers sit. This detail
will need to be developed through Charter
Review. It is important that in any change,
the progress made under the Trust is not
lost. As such Charter Review will also
consider whether Public Value Tests and
Service Licences should be retained or
further improved upon.

Charter Review process

Reviewing the BBC’s Royal Charter
is not just a case of publishing a
consultation. We want to engage
with the public and with industry
to make sure that all views are
given proper consideration. This is
why we are engaging with people
across the UK in a number of ways
to make it easy for everyone to
respond.

The consultation will be open
for 12 weeks from 16 July 2015
to 8 October 2015.
One of the creations of the last Charter
was the BBC Trust – set up to represent
the licence fee payer. The Trust will, in this
role, also be consulting on proposals for
the future of the BBC. We will take full
account of the Trust’s work and work with
them on a range of public and industry
events to explore in detail the important
issues in the coming months.

The Government has also established an
Advisory Group to support the Charter
Review process, providing the Secretary
of State with expert insight into the range
of issues being considered.
More information about the Group and
its membership is available
at www.gov.uk/bbccharterreview

There are also some areas where studies,
reviews and research are needed – to add
technical expertise or independence from
Government. We will be commissioning
these in the coming months. This
process will run through the autumn
and will inform the proposals that the
Government intends to put forward for
further consultation in spring 2016.

What is the
BBC Charter Review?
The BBC is established by a
Royal Charter, rather than an act
of parliament, to underline BBC’s
independence from the government
of the day.

It sets out the public purposes of
the BBC and outlines the respective
duties of the BBC Trust and the
Executive Board.

Why the BBC?
Mission, purpose and values
The BBC has evolved and expanded
from its beginnings in the 1920s
as the UK’s sole broadcaster,
to one of many, providing a
multitude of channels and
services. Beyond the UK’s borders,
the BBC is an internationally
recognised broadcaster and
brand, reaching a weekly global
audience of 308 million people.7
But the context in which the BBC is
operating has changed dramatically
in recent years.

This chapter asks the question, what is the
BBC there to do?
To do this it addresses:
− the rationale for the BBC – what it
was originally, and whether and how
this applies in a dramatically changing
broadcasting and media landscape.
− the BBC’s public purposes – whether
these need to be changed, or reframed
to reﬂect the audience’s changing needs,
expectations and priorities.
− the BBC’s values – whether through
this process of Charter Review they
should be codified, identifying the ways
in which the BBC might be expected
to operate, and informing how the BBC
might assess its performance.

The rationale for the BBC

As with Government intervention
in areas such as health and
education, the core rationale
for the BBC, and public service
broadcasting8 (PSB) policy more
widely, is centred around the need
for the state to intervene in the
market to deliver social outcomes.

The original case for the BBC centred on
limited competition. For the first half of
the twentieth century, spectrum use (and
competition) was extremely limited, with
only one TV broadcaster until the 1950s.
A Public Service Broadcaster was preferred
to a private monopoly. Advancing
technology has changed this. There has
been a steady growth in spectrum used
for broadcasting throughout the latter
half of the twentieth century and the
ten years of the current BBC Charter
have arguably seen the most dramatic
period of change in broadcasting and
telecommunications since the BBC came
into existence.
Following digital TV switchover every
home is a ‘multichannel home’, with
Freeview offering over 70 channels9
and satellite and cable providing access
to hundreds more. 84 per cent of UK
homes have internet access (compared
with 57 per cent in 2006),10 and by the
end of 2017 superfast broadband will be
available to 95 per cent of UK homes
and businesses.11

28

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

The proliferation of mobile devices has
also opened up a multitude of options
for watching and listening alongside, or
instead of, the traditional TV or radio set.
For example, new services such as
Netﬂix, Amazon Prime, Spotify and
Deezer have already begun transforming
peoples’ media habits and expectations,
and we would expect this to continue in
the years ahead.
This increasingly challenges one of the
original rationales for PSB – that the
high barriers to entry require public
intervention. The current generation
of smart televisions,12 and the growing
number of catch-up and on demand
services on offer, provide yet more
choice; the consumer has never been
so well served.
These trends raise questions around the
continued relevance of public service
broadcasting in a modern media age. But
high quality PSB content has generally
been seen as a ‘merit good’, which would

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

be under-provided in a free market.
This is not to argue that private markets
cannot deliver high quality broadcasting.
There are multiple examples of where
commercial broadcasters have in recent
years delivered content of a quality
traditionally seen as the preserve of the
Public Service Broadcasters (PSBs). The
award winning drama series produced by
HBO are one notable case in point. But
PSBs such as the BBC still deliver positive
effects for society such as extending
democratic knowledge through news
and current affairs, helping extend the
UK’s inﬂuence and reputation abroad,
addressing needs of audiences such
as minority language groups, and
serving audiences (such as children)
where excessive advertising would be
inappropriate. These goods would not
be provided in sufficient volume by the
market alone.
Despite technological change, there is still
a strong rationale for the BBC continuing
to exist in the twenty-first century.

29

The rationale for the BBC

The BBC’s current mission,
‘To enrich people’s lives with
programmes and services that
inform, educate and entertain’13
has remained essentially unchanged
since the Corporation’s beginnings,
centred on the values coined by
the BBC’s first Director General,
Lord Reith.

30

There is much to support a continuation
of the BBC’s current mission. It has the
weight of history behind it, is widely
recognised and understood, and licence
fee payers may well expect all three
elements to be provided by the BBC. But
it is not without its critics. In particular,
it is a very broad mission, and one that
risks the BBC competing for ratings not
quality, or distinctiveness, under the
‘entertainment’ banner. On balance the
Government believes that the arguments
in favour of maintaining this historic
mission are sound, although changes to
the purposes, scale and scope may be
required to ensure this does not result in
an overly extended BBC.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Another long-standing part of the BBC’s
approach has been its universality. This
means different things to different people:
− to some, this has meant the BBC should
provide all types of content, and meet
the needs of all audiences, regardless
of the extent of provision by others;

There are clearly questions over which
of these definitions remains most relevant
in the current media age, and whether
it remains important for the BBC to
continue to deliver everything that it
currently does, or traditionally has done,
or whether audience needs are better
served by a more narrowly-focused BBC.

− to others, this has been interpreted
as providing due emphasis on covering
single unifying events such as the
Proms, Royal weddings, and election
coverage; and
− to others, it has meant the requirement
to be available and accessible on all
platforms and devices, free at the point
of use. In recent years, this has meant
a focus by the BBC on expanding its
digital and online services.

The BBC’s public purposes

In the current Charter which came
into effect in January 2007, the
Government set out a high-level
set of public purposes for the BBC
(see Table 1 page 34-36), and the
Trust subsequently set out purpose
remits for each, to set priorities
and criteria against which delivery
would be assessed.

Six public purposes have underpinned
the BBC’s activity over the last Charter
period, and have been part of the
framework against which the BBC have
assessed both the appropriateness and
success of their content and services. This
paper seeks views on the BBC’s public
purposes: whether they provide the
right framework, whether the purposes
themselves are right, and whether they
could or should be redrawn or prioritised.

The BBC’s public purposes:
whether they provide the
right framework, whether
the purposes themselves
are right, and whether
they could or should be
redrawn or prioritised.

32

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

There is a case for maintaining these
purposes. They define broadly what
people expect of the BBC’s output and
by giving only high-level direction allow
the BBC to take decisions about how
these are best delivered. For example,
‘representing the UK’ has enabled the
BBC to broadcast events of national
significance, such as the Royal wedding,
while ‘bringing the UK to the world’
helps support significant investment in
the BBC World Service. The purposes are
also still a relatively new set of high-level
descriptors, so there might be a case for
giving them time to ‘bed in’.
But there is a case for reform of the
purposes. They are very broad, and
arguably it would be difficult for any
programme or activity not to fall within
one of them. By being cast so broadly,
they do not reference directly key genres
such as drama, natural history and news,
widely considered to be at the core of
what the BBC delivers. And they also do
not set clear boundaries for what is or
isn’t appropriate output from the BBC.
So arguably, criticisms levelled at the BBC

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

for being too large or too diffuse in what
it does could be seen as a consequence
of these very broad purposes set by
Government. Conversely, some have
argued for extending the purposes. For
example, the BBC could have more
specific responsibilities for partnership
working, or supporting the wider sector
through training and skills.

How can the BBC’s public purposes
be improved so there is more
clarity about what the BBC should
achieve?

The BBC’s values

The ways in which any public
organisation delivers its mission,
and the ways in which its people
and structures operate, are arguably
just as important as the mission
itself. This is possibly even more
the case for the BBC, in light of the
unique place the organisation holds
in the UK’s media industry, its social
and cultural life, and our collective
sense of identity and British values.

Many organisations make public the
ways in which they will operate through
a statement of values. There are public
documents which refer to BBC values; for
example, the Trust is required to maintain
the independence of the BBC and ensure
it observes high standards of openness
and transparency. The BBC also has a set
of corporate values, setting out for its
employees the ways in which the BBC is
expected to operate. But nowhere is there
set out a formal codified set of values.

The BBC is a public
broadcasting organisation,
and it is right that its
values should reﬂect the
views of the public.

38

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

The last Charter period has proved to
be one of the most tumultuous in the
Corporation’s history, and numerous
issues have arisen which placed the
BBC’s people and working practices
under a great deal of scrutiny.
The BBC is a public broadcasting
organisation, and it is right that its
values should reﬂect the views of the
public. This Charter Review presents
the opportunity to consult on what a
potential set of values might be, against
which its performance can be judged
and measured. Some potential values to
consider are set out in Table 2 opposite.
This includes a potential value around
diversity, which may be merited in the
light of the need to ensure continued
progress by the BBC in this area (see Box 1
on page 40/41).

39

The BBC’s values

Box 1. Diversity
The BBC and the wider broadcasting
sector have faced challenges in regards
to how representative their workforces
are, both on screen and in roles behind
the camera. The BBC announced a
diversity strategy in June 2014, including:
a £2.1 million fund to help Black, Asian
and minority ethnic (BAME) talent on and
off screen to develop new programmes;
more training internships; an Independent
Diversity Action Group chaired by Lord
Hall;15 and setting new targets to increase
senior BAME staff in priority areas from
8.3 per cent to 10 per cent by 2017 and
then to 15 per cent by 2020.16
The BBC has already made some progress
in the last 12 months: the proportion of
BAME staff was 13.2 per cent in February
201517 (compared to 12.6 per cent in
March 2014).

40

In addition, 31 graduate trainee interns
from BAME backgrounds have been
recruited from the Creative Access
Programme and a further six potential
‘Commissioners of the Future’ have
started training in a number of genres.
In terms of disabled staff numbers,
the BBC still has some way to go. The
proportion of disabled staff overall
remained at 3.8 per cent.18 However, there
has been some progress, for example
setting up a work placement scheme for
disabled people, ‘Extend’, which offers
short-term paid work placements, and the
introduction of ManageAble scheme this
year, targeting placements in senior and
decision making roles.19
The BBC has received significant
criticism in recent years regarding its
representation of women on screen,
and has suggested that improving this
remains a priority. However, there is
a better picture when looking at its

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

workforce, with the number of female
staff at 48.5 per cent last February,
marginally lower than in March 2014.
The number of female senior managers
rose to 38.4 per cent and women in
leadership to 41.1 per cent.20
As part of its commitment to deliver
high quality programming that reﬂects
modern Britain, the BBC took an
in-depth look at the portrayal and
inclusion of lesbian, gay and bisexual
people, including audience research
and a public consultation. The resulting
recommendations are currently being
implemented, and as part of their
Diversity Strategy, the BBC has also
committed to a consultation on the
portrayal of age across broadcasters
to inform output and employment
practice across the industry.21

What the BBC does.
Scale and scope
This chapter examines the question
of the appropriate scale and scope
of the BBC, for the forthcoming
Charter period, through the
following lenses:
− Services: whether the BBC is
offering the right range of services,
taking into account market impact;
− Audiences: how well the BBC is
serving different audiences;
− Content: whether the BBC is
providing the right content mix,
quality and distinctiveness; and
− Production: how the content should
be produced.

44

The current Charter sets out the activities
the BBC should undertake to deliver
its public purposes in broad terms. It
states that the main activities should be
providing information, education and
entertainment, through TV, radio and
online services. The Charter also leaves
the BBC free to carry out other activities
where they support the public purposes.22
This framework, with the broad public
purposes considered in the previous
chapter, has given the BBC the motivation
and freedom to develop its services over
the Charter period and builds on the
BBC’s growth, over recent decades, to
become the world’s largest Public Service
Broadcaster (see Box 2 opposite for
European comparisons). As part of Charter
Review, we need to decide whether this
scale and scope is right for the current
and future media environment given the
proliferation of choice.

Services

The range of services provided by
the BBC has grown over recent
decades as digital technology
created opportunities not available
in the analogue age. This was
allowed within the framework of
the current Charter, enabled by the
broad freedom it has given the BBC
in determining how best to meet
its public purposes.

46

BBC services have expanded in recent
years (see Box 3 on page 48/49). Twenty
years ago the BBC had two television
channels, since then the number
has increased to nine (including BBC
Parliament) with the Red Button making
large amounts of additional broadcast
content available. The number of national
radio stations has doubled from five to
ten with the launch of BBC1xtra, BBC
Asian, BBC 5 Live Sports Extra and BBC 6
Music on digital in 2002 and Radio 4 Extra
(formerly Radio 7) which was relaunched
in 2011. Combined with local services,
the BBC now has 57 radio services.
The BBC also has a huge online presence
with the success of its iPlayer and with
the weekly reach of its website in the
UK increasing from 3.9 million in
September 200224 to 24.7 million by
September 2014. 25

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

There are arguments that this service
provision is broadly right in that the
balance of traditional and online
services meets the needs of audiences
in an increasingly fragmented media
environment and that the range of
services helps the BBC to meet its current
remit. There is also an argument that such
provision played a role in the switch to
digital technologies introduced in the late
1990s by broadening the number and type
of free-to-all services available to viewers
and listeners.
However, now digital television switchover
has been completed and as the number
of television and radio channels grow and
the internet as a platform for television
and radio content matures, there are
counter arguments that the BBC does
not need to be providing such a broad
range of services in order to meet its
public service objectives. There is also
an argument that some of the services
might be serving significantly overlapping
audiences – failing to be sufficiently
distinct not only from commercial
output, but from other BBC services.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

A recent example is the BBC Trust’s
report which found a sizeable crossover
in audiences for Radio 1 and Radio 226
– something the BBC has subsequently
worked to address. Given the vast choice
that audiences now have there is an
argument that the BBC might become
more focused on a narrower, core set of
services that can continue to meet its
mission and objectives. A smaller BBC
could see the public pay less for their
TV licence and would also be likely to
have a reduced market impact (see Box 4
on page 50/51).

Box 4: Market impacts
It is important that we understand both
the positive and negative effects the BBC
can have on the wider market.
In terms of positive impacts,
some say that:
− The BBC has an impact in raising
broadcasting standards. The licence
fee offers the BBC a stable, long-term
source of funding, which allows it to
invest in content, for example highvalue ﬂagship drama, and technology,
such as the iPlayer. If commercial
broadcasters want to keep up and
deliver audiences to advertisers they
need to match the BBC’s quality and
delivery. This could deliver more choice
and quality to audiences.

− The BBC’s ability to spend large
amounts on both the people in
its organisation and in UK content
can result in positive effects for
the creative industries, including
independent producers, and in
training skills and talent that benefit
commercial parties, too.
On the other hand, it is argued that:
− The commercial television sector
can struggle to compete with freely
distributed BBC content. BBC News 24,
for example, introduced in 1997, was
aimed at broadly the same market as
Sky News, and Channel 4 and ITV in
particular are impacted by the BBC’s
provision for prime-time audiences.
− There is a longer term risk the BBC’s
radio market share could grow further
unless commercial advertising revenues
remain robust. The BBC accounts for
around 60 per cent of total radio
revenues and has held around a

50

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

55 per cent audience share during the
current Charter.
− The BBC has a variety of impacts
on online markets. For example, the
popularity of BBC News in the UK
(BBC News website had an average
27 million UK weekly browsers in
early 2015, and more than 65 million
worldwide)27 has led to suggestions
that the scale of BBC’s online offer
is impeding the ability of other UK
news outlets to develop profitable
business models, such as paywalls
and subscriptions, in existing and
new markets.
− Some sectors are impacted by more
than one of the BBC’s services. Local
newspapers have found their business
model eroded over recent years as new
technologies, changes to consumer
behaviour, loss of advertising and
other market pressures have created
significant challenges. The BBC does
not provide services at as granular

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

a level as local providers but could,
in providing a wide range of content
online as well as on radio and TV,
have an impact on efforts by local
news groups to develop compelling
online local and hyper-local services.
− the BBC’s ability to cross-promote
its own services has an impact on
the wider market. There is a case for
the BBC marketing its own services
and programmes, particularly where
it is directing people towards content
such as documentaries and current
affairs that they might not otherwise
consume. But given other services are
not able to advertise their content on
the BBC there is a case for arguing that
the nature and extent of this crosspromotion needs to be considered.

51

Services

The BBC also has the potential to act
as an effective partner in a number of
markets as it has, for example, within the
arts and cultural sectors. In the instance
of local newspapers and other local media
providers, the BBC can help support the
industry by giving exposure to regionallyproduced content and clear attribution
when it uses news stories originally
generated by or developed by the
local press.
Commercial partnerships are an approach
that BBC Worldwide has used in other
areas, for example the BBC is part of a
joint venture which saw UKTV (which
has six paid-for channels and four freeto-air) set up in 1997 and which has
seen revenues grow in recent years.28
The section on digital services below
references the way in which the BBC has

During the current Charter period, the
BBC has played a key role, as requested
by Government, in developing digital
infrastructure for the UK.

52

begun to explore alternative delivery
platforms to deliver content, such as the
tie-in between YouTube and Radio 1.
However, partnerships raise complex
issues including, for example, the way in
which the BBC chooses its partners.

Digital services
Of the BBC’s services it is the digital
services that have arguably seen the
greatest rate of change, particularly with
the development of the iPlayer.
The current Charter contains a sixth
purpose: to deliver to the public the
benefit of emerging communications
technologies and services. The BBC
has played a key role, as requested
by Government, in developing digital
infrastructure for the UK. This includes:
− Investing to extend digital terrestrial
coverage of all BBC services to facilitate
Digital TV Switchover (one of the UK’s
largest engineering projects)29 and
playing a leading role in introducing
Freeview, the UK’s largest television
platform and FreeSat – the subscription
free satellite service – both of which are

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

operated with commercial broadcasters
as joint ventures;
− £150 million per year from 2013 to
2017 in broadband roll-out to enable
95 per cent of households to benefit
from superfast broadband;30
− Making up to £25 million available from
2012 to 2017 to develop infrastructure
for Local TV as well as up to £15 million
to fund content produced by local TV
services31; and
− Extending national Digital Audio
Broadcasting (DAB) services to
97 per cent of households by 2017
and supporting commercial radio’s
investment in local DAB coverage
to improve digital coverage of BBC
nations and local radio services32.
Alongside the development of the
hugely successful iPlayer the BBC is now
exploring emerging online platforms for
delivering content through providers
such as Facebook and Netﬂix. It has also
used new types of digital services to
enhance traditional ones, such as Radio 1’s
YouTube channel which has 1.3 million
subscribers (a third of them 13-17 years
BBC Charter Review: public consultation

old) and which led to the launch of a
dedicated Radio 1 iPlayer video channel.
This has been supported by research and
development into audience behaviours.
Radio 1’s YouTube channel has

1.3m

subscribers

of which are 13-17 years old

Looking forward, there is an important
question about the balance between
traditional broadcasting, online and digital
distribution. On the one hand, there is the
view that by developing at the cutting
edge the BBC is able to adapt to changing
consumer demand and continue to
serve diverse and fragmented audiences,
particularly young people. However, there
is the counter argument that the rapid
growth in digital and online services more
broadly means that the market is already
well served and that the BBC, as a major
player, potentially squeezes out others who
want to develop new ways of managing
and distributing content.

53

Services

These debates are currently being played
out in relation to the decision to move
BBC Three online. There is also a question
of the BBC’s role in digital radio (see Box 5
opposite) given the need for the BBC to
make significant investment in upgrading
FM and AM networks in the next ten years.
Of course, any decision to provide content
on a variety of platforms needs to take
into account the financial implications
of this approach. And it remains the
case that, despite the increase in online
viewing, traditional broadcast television
remains robust with the latest Ofcom
Communications Market 2014 report
setting out that live viewing still accounts
for 89 per cent of total viewing.33

Box 5: Digital radio
Digital radio listening has reached
40 per cent of all radio listening and
nearly 55 per cent of adults listen to
digital radio services at least weekly.34
Supported by the growth of new
commercial digital services, the radio
industry expects digital listening to
overtake analogue listening at some
point in 2017. At that point, Government
will need to consider the timetable for
a future switch-off of analogue radio
services at a date likely to start
after 2020.

The BBC has played a crucial role
in the development of digital radio
including taking leading role in the
technical development of Digital Audio
Broadcasting (DAB) and DAB+ services.
Phase 4 of the roll-out of BBC national
DAB coverage (covering more than
97 per cent of homes) will be completed
by the end of 2015. The BBC is also
funding a significant expansion of local
DAB coverage as the result of a unique
partnership with DCMS and Commercial
Radio. This programme is due to be
completed in September 2016.

The precise role of the BBC in the
transition will depend on how a radio
switchover is planned and delivered
which will need to be considered after
the 50 per cent listening threshold is
reached. But it could include:

There is a case for the BBC to play
a central role in any future radio
switchover, as it did with the successful
television switchover programme.
This will require the build-out of BBC
national services to match the coverage
of its national FM network. The BBC’s
analogue radio networks will require
significant investment from the early
2020s onwards if no timetable for
switchover is set.

− making support available to older
and more vulnerable listeners,
though the evidence from a successful
switchover trial study in Bath found
that the process to be much more
straightforward than for television.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

− supporting the long-term
communications with audiences
and industry that will be needed
to support a switchover;
− working with commercial radio and
industry on technical developments
that will improve digital radio; and

55

Services

There are also access and control
implications for BBC content being
available on a variety of other platforms,
whether subscription or not. The BBC is
among a number of organisations to trial
a system where articles are hosted on
Facebook, rather than the user following
a link to the BBC, raising wider concerns
about user data and the context in which
content is viewed, which the BBC has
acknowledged.

Research and development
It is argued that the media sector and
the UK economy has benefited from the
BBC’s role in innovation with the BBC
undertaking research and development
which would not have been picked
up by the wider market. This includes
improvements in compression technology,
the development of ultra HD standards
and collaboration with groups such as the
Digital Television Group and international

56

technical standards bodies. The BBC has
also worked with Innovate UK (formerly
the Technology Strategy Board) on a
number of projects including Thira35 and
the RadioPlayer.
There are legitimate questions, however,
about whether the BBC should continue
to try to lead the way development of
new technology ahead of the market.
The cost of BBC development last year
was £83 million.36 The BBC’s role in
the development and deployment of
new technologies – particularly online
distribution – has the potential to impact
negatively on the ability of commercial
competitors to monetise emerging
technologies, and could crowd out new
start-ups. There may be savings to the
licence fee payer from provision of some
of these developments by the market.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Question 4
Is the expansion of the BBC’s
services justified in the context of
increased choice for audiences? Is
the BBC crowding out commercial
competition and, if so, is this
justified?
Question 5
Where does the evidence suggest
the BBC has a positive or negative
wider impact on the market?
Question 6
What role should the BBC have in
inﬂuencing the future technological
landscape including in future radio
switchover?

Audiences

This section gives an overview of
the BBC’s audience and how the
different segments are being served.
This is important as it informs the
question of what services the BBC
should be delivering.

Almost all adults in the
UK use BBC services each
week, giving the BBC a
central place in people’s
lives.

58

The BBC is reaching a wide audience
within the UK. According to BBC audience
research almost all adults in the UK use
BBC services each week,37 giving the BBC
a central place in people’s lives.
However, the BBC’s reach and people’s
satisfaction with the BBC vary across
different groups in society. Some groups
appear to be served particularly well:
broadly speaking, older age groups
and people from a white British ethnic
background are the most likely to use
BBC services, with especially high figures
for watching television and listening to the
radio. Some groups appear to be served
less well by current BBC programming:
the BBC Trust’s Purpose Remit Survey
shows that audiences from black ethnic
groups in particular are least likely to say
that the BBC is effective at representing
their ethnicity.38 This is not only an issue
for the BBC. Ofcom’s third PSB Review
found that more than half of viewers
from black ethnic groups felt they were
both under-represented and negatively
portrayed by all of the PSBs.39

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Data also shows that BBC audiences
are broadly equal across both genders,
(with women watching only slightly
more TV content than men), and by
socio-economic groups.40
Use of the BBC by different age groups
is also important: 16-24 year-olds are
engaging less with traditional television
and radio than any other age group,41 a
trend that has remained stable over the
period of the current Charter and which
covers all broadcast TV channels. At the
same time, this age group is more likely
to say that the BBC has something to
offer them than some groups which are
more likely to engage with traditional
broadcasters.42 Ofcom’s PSB Review also
raises a number of pertinent points on
audience behaviour and how audiences
feel about PSB provision.43 Understanding
the BBC’s audiences and their different
needs and willingness to fund BBC
services will be important in thinking
about the scale and scope of the BBC’s
activities for the next decade.

Audiences

Local, regional and national
The BBC has clear obligations to provide
services for all of its audiences, particularly
as set out under the fourth public purpose
(‘Representing the UK, its Nations,
Regions and Communities’). As well as
drawing audiences together for events of
national significance the BBC also needs
to represent and reﬂect licence fee payers,
including to the wider world.

60

The degree to which the BBC has
succeeded in meeting these obligations
is mixed. According to the BBC Trust,
last year about six in ten UK adults
agreed that the BBC performed well
in representing their nation or region.44
However, performance scores in
‘Representing my nation/region in news/
drama’ in Scotland have remained
consistently lower than in Wales and
Northern Ireland throughout the Charter
period. Information on minority languages
is set out in Box 6 opposite.

Box 6: Supporting the different
native languages within the
British Isles
In serving specific communities, the
BBC’s role in supporting the different
native languages within the British
Isles is particularly important. This is a
small market with limited potential to
be served effectively by commercial
broadcasters, and therefore a key area
where public funding can support
underserved audiences. For example,
S4C, the Welsh language broadcaster,
currently receives public funding
both via direct Government grant
(£6.8 million per year) and also via
the licence fee (£74.5 million per year).
And Gaelic language broadcasting in
Scotland is provided through BBC Alba,
a partnership channel between the BBC
and the Gaelic authority, MG Alba.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

Nearly two thirds of minority language
speakers in the UK say that the BBC
supports their language.45 But while
the BBC and licence fee funded services
are clearly an important pillar for
indigenous language communities there
are also challenges: audience reach has
been falling across some indigenous
language services over the last few
years, particularly in Wales.46 And these
services come at a cost; cost per hour
of indigenous language radio content
in Scotland and Wales is considerably
higher than cost per hour for English
speaking content which raises concerns
about value for money.47

Audiences

International audiences
The BBC also has a public purpose to bring
the UK to the world and bring the world
to the UK. This international audience
has increased as connectivity and uptake
have improved – around 46 per cent of
households have internet access today
compared to 18 per cent in 200548 – and
new services and platforms give audiences
around the world a better ability to access
BBC services (see Box 7 on pages 66/67).
To illustrate the reach of the BBC globally,
the 50th anniversary episode of Doctor
Who set a record for the largest ever
simulcast of a TV drama: shown in 98
countries across six continents, in 15
languages. The BBC has a weekly global
audience of 308 million people and the
BBC’s weekly international news audience
is now 283 million people49, compared to
233 million in 2006-07.50 Additionally, the
BBC is consistently rated the most trusted
and best-known international news
provider with global audiences rating

it more unbiased, objective and higher
quality than other news channels.51

focussed public purpose. Bringing the

purposes in 2013-14.52

Serving this global audience has benefits
for the UK. The BBC plays a big part
in how the UK is perceived globally.
Audiences who consume BBC services
more frequently have more positive
views of the UK than those who have
less exposure to the BBC.53 There is also
a financial return for the UK: while news
provision is free in the countries provided,
BBC Worldwide sells BBC programmes for
broadcast around the world bringing in
revenue which is reinvested in the BBC’s
programming.

In this context Tony Hall, Director General
of the BBC, has set an ambitious target of
reaching 500 million people by 2022, the
BBC’s centenary.54

Question 7
How well is the BBC serving
its national and international
audiences?

While the BBC has been very successful
on the world stage, that stage is changing.
The internet is making a global reach
cheaper. Convergence of different services
is bringing the BBC into competition with
new players such as Amazon, Google and
Apple. And in world news, in addition to
well established providers like CNN, it is
facing growing competition from AlJazeera and state funded broadcasters in
Russia and China.

Content

At the heart of the BBC’s delivery of
its public purposes lies the content
it brings to its audiences. The type
and the quality of its content
allows the BBC to inform, educate
and entertain. A high standard
of BBC content is crucial to the
successful delivery of its mission
and value to the licence fee payer.

The Framework Agreement
accompanying the current Charter sets
out that BBC content needs to display at
least one of the following criteria: high
quality, challenging, original, innovative
and engaging.
The BBC’s unique funding structure,
receiving a substantial level of public
funding, gives the BBC the ability to take
risks with the content it provides and
bring new and untested formats to its
audiences.
In this context, Charter Review will
consider in particular:
− Genre mix – does the BBC have the
balance right between genres;

The BBC’s unique funding
structure, receiving a
substantial level of public
funding, gives the BBC the
ability to take risks with

− Quality and distinctiveness – the
extent to which the BBC is meeting
the Framework criteria, and audiences’
expectations, for quality and innovation.

Content

Genre mix
The BBC’s decisions about genre mix
are a critical component for the value it
provides to the public. These are set out
at a high-level by the BBC Trust through
Service Licences and delivered by the BBC
through each of its services. There are two
main ways of measuring genre mix within
services and across the BBC: on television
and radio through hours broadcast and
across television, radio and online through
funding (see Box 8 on pages 70/71).
Television
Television accounted for three quarters
(£1.89 billion) of BBC content spend in
2014. Childrens’ and factual together
account for over 50 per cent of television
hours. However, since different genres
have very different costs some of the
BBC’s largest amounts of spend are on
sports, drama and factual programming
which together account for nearly half of
BBC television content spend. Spend by
genre has changed significantly over the
Charter period, as the BBC has made a
number of strategic choices by changing

72

the numbers of hours in the different
genres (see Box 9 on pages 74/75). But
the BBC also, like other broadcasters,
had to deal with increases in costs, for
example, in drama. The Charter period
has also seen the value of sports rights
continue to increase in an international
market which puts pressure on the BBC’s
ability to retain live coverage of high-value
sporting events, such as the Open Golf
Championships.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Radio
Radio accounted for around 20 per cent of
content spend amounting to £474 million
in 2014 (see Box 8 on pages 70/71).
The BBC spends around 55 per cent of
its content spend on the five national
stations (Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3, Radio 4
and Radio 5 Live), 6 per cent on the digital
only stations and 39 per cent on BBC
nations and local stations. The BBC’s radio
audiences have remained broadly stable
over the current Charter period.
Online
BBC Online accounts for about 5 per cent
of the BBC’s overall content budget,
amounting to £125 million56 on a
variety of online services. This includes
expenditure on the BBC’s desktop, TV,
tablet and mobile online services covering
the range of content provided by the
BBC’s websites. It also covers the digital
interactive services delivered through
the BBC’s Red Button and the services
available through the BBC’s iPlayer. The
BBC Annual Report and Accounts for

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

2014-15 also highlight the introduction
of the myBBC programme, allowing
greater personalisation of BBC services
which started this year with the facility
to personalise content on the BBC
news app.57
Quality and distinctiveness
The BBC can only meet its objectives if
audiences see its content as a desirable
and quality proposition, particularly in an
increasingly competitive and global media
landscape with ever more options for
audiences’ time and spending.
The BBC Trust’s audience research
suggests that the BBC has been
reasonably successful in meeting
audiences expectations of quality,
showing that public views of BBC content
and quality have been relatively stable
across the Charter period and that
audiences are largely satisfied with BBC
content (See Box 10 on page 77).

Content

A critical aspect of quality, as it relates
to the BBC’s news and current affairs
provision, is that it is duly impartial and
avoids bias towards particular views or
voices.58 This has been the subject of
numerous independent and internal
reviews, from the Lord Wilson Report
(2005)59, to the more recent Stuart
Prebble Review of ‘Breadth of Opinion
Reﬂected in the BBC’s Output’, in 2013.60
The second question on content relates to
whether, across the various formats, the
BBC is providing sufficiently distinctive
content. The BBC provides a wide range
of content across platforms which would
either not be provided or under-provided
by the wider market. For example,
distinctive natural history series such as
Planet Earth, in-depth classical music and
arts programming on Radio 3, innovative
documentary series such as a History of
the World in 100 Objects for Radio 4, and
quality science programming such as
Horizon.

76

However, it also provides a range of
programming which is arguably less
distinctive from the content that its
commercial competitors provide. In
providing audiences with popular content
the BBC is able to reach a wide base of
licence fee payers, and an element of
popular programming is essential to the
BBC continuing to deliver services that
audiences want to access. However,
concerns have been raised that the
BBC behaves in an overly commercial
way, encroaching on TV genres and
formats that could be served well by its
commercial competitors, particularly
during the peak hours that are crucial for
their ability to raise revenue. This can play
out at the level of services: the content
budget for Radio 6 is £8 million compared
to the combined almost £87 million for
the arguably less distinctive Radio 1 and
2,61 while the BBC Trust has found that
its highest spending service BBC 1 has
the lowest score for ‘fresh and new’ of
its main channels.62

Content

This does not mean that the BBC should
not be entertaining; it is about the BBC
providing distinctive programming across
all genre types. For example, the BBC
acquired the format for The Voice. This
was a singing talent show developed
overseas, bought by the BBC at a reported
cost of around £20 million64 and similar
to ITV’s X-Factor. This is in contrast
to Strictly Come Dancing which was
developed by the BBC in-house and then
sold abroad.
The BBC has faced similar questions
about distinctiveness of its radio content,
particularly in relation to its music
stations in peak hours. In its recent report
on BBC Radio 1, perhaps the BBC’s most
‘mainstream’ radio service, the BBC Trust
found that the overlap of music played on
Radio 1 with five comparator commercial
stations was low, at around one third of
its output.
On the other hand, the Trust also found
that BBC Radio 1’s requirement to
broadcast 40 new documentaries a year,
while met by the station, currently has

78

relatively little impact among audiences:
the current scheduling slot of Tuesday
evenings at 9pm outside peak hours
means that few tune in and audience
awareness of this is low.65
Similarly, questions have been raised
about whether content carried on the
BBC’s website is sufficiently distinctive
from content that can and is being
developed and delivered by others.
The growth of the internet as a medium
for consuming information is one of the
most notable developments over the
current Charter period; in this context the
challenge for the BBC will be in setting
itself apart from others in the online space
and potentially seeking to avoid providing
services such as, for example, recipes
where a range of other websites already
do so.
The BBC, as a public institution, should
not have the same imperatives as
commercial companies such as trying
to maximise audience share. However,
given the difficulty in measuring quality
in an objective way, figures such as

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

ratings can be given undue prominence
by senior management. The question is,
therefore, how to measure the success of
programming when much depends on the
BBC’s ability to deliver its public purposes
through its content, and how to make
sure the culture of the BBC is focused on
quality and distinctiveness rather than
driven by ratings.

Question 8
Does the BBC have the right genre
mix across its services?
Question 9
Is the BBC’s content sufficiently
high quality and distinctive from
that of other broadcasters?
What reforms could improve it?

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

Content production

This section considers the
regulatory framework around
content production and the
options for reform.

PSBs continue to play a vital role in the
success of the independent production
sector, investing (including sport)
£2.5 billion in UK first-run content in
201466, and accounting for the bulk of
investment in the UK’s independent
production sector.
The BBC accounted for more than half
(almost £1.3 billion) of PSB investment
in 2014, making the BBC the largest
commissioner of television content
in the UK market.67 The regulatory
framework surrounding the way the
BBC commissions and produces content
therefore has a significant impact on the
independent production sector and the
wider media and creative economy. It
also affects the efficiency with which the
licence fee is spent. It should be noted
that Ofcom’s Review has found that
investment in new UK-originated content
has fallen in recent years.

The BBC accounted for more than half
(almost £1.3 billion) of PSB investment
in 2014, making the BBC the largest
commissioner of television content
in the UK market.

80

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Current system
The current regulatory framework
of content production has two main
elements: quotas and Terms of Trade.
BBC quotas
The BBC commissions, produces and
acquires vast amounts of TV and radio
programming and online content. This
output is shaped by the quotas the
BBC is required to meet in respect of
commissions and productions. These
cover independent productions for
TV, radio and online as well as original
and regional productions for TV (see
Box 11 on page 82). Over the course
of the current Charter period, the BBC
has delivered against these quotas, as
reﬂected in the BBC Trust’s report on the
supply arrangements for the production
of BBC content and services published
in June 2015.68

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

81

Content production

Box 11: Current BBC content supply quotas
Television
− 25 per cent of BBC television
commissioning hours are guaranteed
to independent producers, 50 per cent
are guaranteed to BBC in-house
producers and 25 per cent are open
to competition from in-house and
external production companies
under the Window of Creative
Competition (WOCC).
− There are also quotas for original
productions, for out-of-London
productions (50 per cent of network
television spend from outside London
by 2016) including production in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
(at least 17 per cent of network
television spend).

82

Radio
− At least 10 per cent of eligible radio
hours are independently produced
with a further 10 per cent available

introduced in 2012.69

Online
− The target is for 25 per cent of
eligible online spend to go to
independent suppliers.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Terms of Trade
The way the BBC commissions and
produces content fits within a broader
regulatory regime. The Terms of Trade,
established in 2003 to address the
imbalanced negotiating position between
broadcasters and smaller companies
in the independent production sector,
require negotiations to comply with a
code of practice approved by Ofcom (see
Box 12 below). Under the current system
the intellectual property rights associated
with programmes typically accrue
85 per cent to the production company
and only 15 per cent to the commissioner.

Box 12: Terms of Trade
Broadcasters have the right to use a
programme a set number of times in
the primary licence window (typically
two years). On expiration of the
window independent producers retain
copyright and intellectual property
rights, video and DVD royalties and
merchandising. Net profits are shared
on a negotiated basis but a typical
position is an 85 per cent producer –
15 per cent broadcaster share.
BBC Charter Review: public consultation

83

Content production

Ofcom’s recent PSB Review considered
whether a re-balancing of the Terms of
Trade is required and its conclusions are
referenced below.

While successful, there are a number
of reasons for considering the content
production picture through Charter
Review. In particular:

Rationale for reform

− The impact of the current system.
In respect of television programming,
the BBC has suggested the current
structure sees innovation and creativity
stiﬂed, arguing its in-house production
unit is restricted to only producing
content for the BBC. Moreover, there is
a question about whether the operation
of the quota system is administratively
burdensome for the BBC and the BBC
Trust.

There are strengths to the current quota
system. It has helped the independent
production market grow on average
3.4 per cent each year between 2009
and 2013, generating nearly £3 billion
in revenues in 2013.70 It has also helped
drive up production in the nations and
regions with the total number of network
hours originating in London decreasing
from 65 per cent in 2009 to 41 per cent
in 2013.71 At the same time it has enabled
BBC in-house productions to continue
to make high quality content.

84

− The size of the quotas. For radio
content, the BBC’s dominant position
on speech radio, taken together
with the comparatively low quotas
for independent production, may
be constraining a small but vibrant
sector, which – as the recent New
York Festival’s International Radio
Programme Awards has shown –
delivers truly innovative content and
formats. The BBC announced, on

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

19 June, the intention to phase out radio
quotas and to give radio independents
greater opportunities to compete for
commissions.
− The range of quotas. For online
content, the impact that the BBC’s
online presence can have on others
should be considered – not least on
local news outlets, some of which have
raised concerns that the BBC’s local
presence is having an adverse impact
on consumption of their content.
This includes concerns that in some
instances the BBC draws on content
that local news organisations source
without giving appropriate credit, so
prompting calls for a specific local news
quota to be established.
This changing environment prompted
the BBC Trust to launch a review into the
BBC’s content supply arrangements earlier
this year, which reported on 19 June.72
The report concluded that there are
arguments for amending the quotas in
place for TV, radio and online content
but noted that full details of the BBC’s

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

Studios proposal, set out below, and the
outcome of Ofcom’s Third PSB Review in
respect of the overall position on Terms
of Trade were required before coming
to a full decision. Ofcom’s report was
published on 2 July and found that the
consolidation and vertical integration
(production companies being acquired
by broadcasters) which has taken place
in the UK’s production market has led to
benefits as well as risks for broadcasters.73
Ofcom concluded that while it did not
believe there was a strong case for reform
of programming quotas for independent
production it would continue to monitor
developments in light of the fact that
the sector will continue to change and
may consolidate further. These findings,
along with any further outcomes from the
BBC Trust’s and Ofcom’s reviews will be
considered during Charter Review.

85

Content production

There are three main options for
reforming the current system (in addition
to the related question for the case for
amending the current Terms of Trade):
amending existing quotas; the BBC
Studios proposal; and directly scaling back
in-house production.

Amending existing quotas
There is a range of options for
amending the quota system:
− expanding the current quotas for
independent production across TV,
radio or online;
− including a quota requirement
for local news provision;
− expanding the TV or radio Window of
Creative Competition (WOCCs) and
introducing a WOCC for online content;
− reviewing the arrangements
for regional production;
− assessing quotas by value
rather than hours; or
− any combination of the options above.
Government would be particularly
interested in views on whether to lower
the in-house guarantee, allowing a greater
proportion of hours to be provided by
external producers. This could either
be as a new set quota for independent
producers, expanded competition through
the WOCC, or a combination of the two.

86

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Box 13: Regional Delivery
The BBC has successfully transitioned
parts of its organisation and spend
outside of London, notably helping
drive the media hub in Salford. However,
there is still a question about whether
it has yet found the optimal geographic
spread. While there may be operational
cost associated with having numerous
regional hubs, some argue that the BBC
could and should be doing more where
it is cost effective to do so.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

One such example is the BBC’s spend
in the Midlands. A recent campaign
in the Midlands has highlighted a
marked disparity between the level
of licence fee collected in the region
(citing £942 million), and the amount
of the BBC’s investment there (citing
£80 million – or 8.5 per cent). The BBC
have set out their plans to increase
spending and jobs in the Midlands in the
coming years, and to make Birmingham
a centre of excellence for skills,
training and development for the UK.
However, such concerns are relevant to
consideration of how successful the BBC
has been in meeting its obligations over
the Charter period.

Content production

The BBC Studios proposal
The BBC Executive has indicated that
it believes change is needed to the
way its content is produced, not least
because of wider changes over the
current Charter period, both in respect of
supply of content and the way in which
it is distributed. For example, digital
switchover, improved connectivity and
increasing use of the internet has led to
a diversification of distribution models,
with new competitors such as Netﬂix and
YouTube making an entrance.

88

In the past year, Lord Hall has called
for a ‘compete and compare’ approach.
This would remove quotas from BBC
production, allow independent producers
to bid for BBC commissions (with the
exception of current affairs, sport and
children’s content) and set up BBC Studios
as a commercial subsidiary of the BBC,
able to bid on a commercial basis for
commissions and make programmes
for other broadcasters.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

The BBC argues that this proposal, the
detail of which has not yet been published
but is expected later this year, would
increase competition and drive quality
and diversity in programme-making. It
would also, the BBC argues, address the
challenges in-house productions face from
changes to the supply chain, with growing
consolidation in the production market.

Concerns have also been raised publicly
that such a move could potentially give
rise to State aid concerns and that greater
detail about the delivery of BBC Studios
is required.74 Government is seeking
views on these proposals and welcomes
evidence setting out any potential
benefits or concerns BBC Studios may
give rise to.

These proposals have, however, attracted
some criticism. Setting up the BBC’s
production unit as a commercial
subsidiary would see it become one of the
UK’s largest content producers in direct
competition with the approximately 400
production companies in the UK.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

89

Content production

Directly scaling back
in-house production
As noted above, the predominant way
in which content is produced for the
BBC, across television, radio and online,
is through in-house production units
(delivering 55 per cent, 78 per cent and
70 per cent respectively for television
and radio hours and online spend for
2013-14). This has a number of benefits
including retention of intellectual property
rights allowing (under the current Terms
of Trade) commercial exploitation, the
development of a skilled production
workforce, and delivery of high quality,
well-received content.

90

There is, however, a need to consider
the extent to which the BBC needs to
operate as the country’s largest single
content provider employing some 2,000
people. While BBC productions has a
well-earned reputation for quality, many
independent production companies
can offer similar production values –
and indeed many of the BBC’s most
recognised programmes such as Question
Time and David Attenborough’s First Life
are already produced by the independent
sector. It is in this context that the former
Director General, Lord Grade, said in
evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport
Select Committee and quoted in the
Committee’s final report, that the BBC
should look to outsource production
processes and facilities to “a private sector
more capable of absorbing the work”.75

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

There are also questions about how
well the BBC’s in-house production
compares, both on price and quality.
In recent years, when the BBC has
competed for commissions on an equal
footing with independent producers
through the WOCC, the BBC only won
17 to 30 per cent of commissions (see
Box 14 opposite). This could imply that
independent production companies
deliver better value for money for the
licence fee payer. As a result, Government
is keen to understand whether there are
arguments for scaling back the BBC’s
production capabilities and what the
impact of this might be on audiences,
other broadcasters and the production
sector as a whole.

Question 10
How should the system of content
production be improved through
reform of quotas or more radical
options?

BBC funding

We have looked at the scale and
scope of the BBC and its purposes,
which are clearly related to the
amount of public money the
BBC receives, who pays for it and
how it is funded.

A licence is required by
anyone in the UK viewing
live (or nearly-live) TV
from any source.

94

Included in an agreement with the BBC
to take on responsibility for funding free
TV licences for the over 75s, Summer
Budget 2015 signalled a number of
reforms which will be developed through
Charter Review. These include the BBC’s
funding settlement and in particular the
level of the licence fee (or alternative
funding model), on which no decision has
yet been taken.
The BBC currently receives over
£3.7 billion of public investment each
year from the TV licence fee. Public
money is supplemented by commercial
revenues generated by the BBC, giving the
BBC Group an overall income of almost
£5 billion a year. Commercial revenues are
largely generated through BBC Worldwide
and are reinvested in the BBC to pursue its
public purposes through a dividend. The
licence fee is a significant intervention in
the broadcasting market and therefore it
is right that Government look at this issue
through Charter Review.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

This chapter looks at four funding issues:
− The funding model: options for future
funding models for the BBC including
a modernised licence fee, an alternative
household levy and elements of
subscription. This section will also
consider the issue of decriminalisation
of TV licence evasion;
− Protected uses of licence fee funds:
what the licence fee can and must
be used for, including the option of
contestable funding;
− Value for money and efﬁciency:
how the BBC spends its money and the
mechanisms for making sure it makes
savings where possible;
− The BBC’s commercial activities:
how the BBC generates its own income.

Box 16: The history of the licence fee
The first wireless licence fee was
launched in 1923 and covered radio
services only. It was collected by the Post
Office with both the Post Office and
the Treasury receiving a portion of the
income.76 The combined television and
radio licence fee was introduced in June
1946 to cover the costs of operation of
the 405-line (monochrome analogue
television) service. In 1968, following the
commencement of colour transmissions,
a colour television supplement was added
to the licence fee and in 1971 radio-only
licences were abolished.
In 1991 the BBC assumed responsibility
for the collection and enforcement of
the television licence fee from the Home
Office. The BBC carries out this work
under the trademark of “TV Licensing”.

96

A licence is now required by anyone in
the UK viewing live (or nearly-live)77 TV
from any source. The vast majority of
the income from this is used for the
BBC’s provision of its services with a
small portion used for other projects
that support the BBC’s purposes, such as
digital switchover and broadband roll-out.
The current cost of a colour TV licence
is £145.50 and the cost of a black and
white licence is £49.00. Concessions are
available for blind people, those aged 75
and over, and those living in qualifying
residential care accommodation.
The level of the television licence fee,
concessions and payment plans are set
out in the Communication (Television
Licensing) Regulations 2004 (as
amended).

Funding model

The primary source of funding
for the BBC is the licence fee
which has existed in various forms
over time, as set out at Box 16
on page 48.

As a funding mechanism the licence fee
has a number of strengths:
− it has provided a direct link between
the licence fee payer and the service
provided by the BBC;
− it has provided sustained, predictable
levels of funding for the BBC that have
allowed the organisation to invest and
provide the services we enjoy today;
− it provides a degree of independence
from the Government; and
− it helps enable the BBC to produce
content that certain other forms of
funding (such as subscription) may
not provide.

No funding option is
perfect and all involve
trade-offs between
separate and, at times,
competing objectives.

98

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

However the licence fee has also
attracted a number of criticisms:
− it is regressive and requires everyone
to pay the same ﬂat rate regardless
of income;
− it is not correlated to use – someone
who uses the BBC very little pays as
much as someone who uses it a lot;
− it is compulsory for watching any TV
channel, not just the BBC, which means
there is also no choice for those who
want to opt-out of BBC services;

Options for change
There is a range of options for reforming
funding of the BBC. No funding option is
perfect and all involve trade-offs between
separate and, at times, competing
objectives (see Box 17 on page 100). The
feasibility and desirability of any options
will also change over time in reaction
to changes in audience behaviours and
the market, therefore any consideration
of funding models will need to take a
dynamic view.

− it is enforced by criminal sanctions; and
− there is an inequity in only requiring a
licence to watch live television when it
also funds radio, online and on demand
content as well as other commitments
such as broadband roll-out.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

99

Funding model

Box 17: Funding model criteria
In assessing the respective strengths
and weaknesses of different models it is
important to consider what criteria are
desirable in a funding model.

− simplicity and low administration
cost – keeping the funding model
simple and transparent and minimising
administration costs;

They might include:

− acceptability – the public’s view on
the relative merits of funding models;

− ability to pay/progressivity –
considering individuals’ income and
ability to pay;
− fairness – relating payment to the
value of the benefits that a fee payer
receives;
− certainty – giving the BBC the
stability to invest in long-term
projects such as the Digital Switchover
and taxpayers certainty over their
liabilities;
− efﬁciency – the BBC driving economic
efficiency;

100

− sustainability – future-proofing to
prepare for technological change and
to ensure it is relevant in the future;
− feasibility – technical, legal and
financial implementation and delivery;
− extent – generating sufficient funds
to pay for BBC services and any
other commitments such as the
World Service and broadband rollout (covered in more detail in the
protected uses of licence fee funds
section below).

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

There are two options which are generally
considered not appropriate for the BBC
and which we are not minded to pursue
in detail through this Charter Review:
− Funding solely from advertising
revenue. This is not deemed
appropriate because, as shown in
evidence to the Culture, Media and
Sport Select Committee’s Future of the
BBC review, there is little appetite for a
move to an advertising model. Such a
move is seen as undesirable because the
market is not large enough to sustain an
organisation the size of the BBC in its
entirety. Moving to such a model would
likely have significant negative impacts
for others in the market, including
other Public Service Broadcasters’
ability to finance public service content,
and an overall diminishing in value of
advertising minutage. Audiences may
also be negatively affected by such
a change, as advert-free content is a
popular aspect of the BBC.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

− Funding through general taxation.
This is not appropriate because it would
risk lessening the BBC’s independence
from Government. It could also
potentially result in greater funding
uncertainty and would have an impact
on the Government’s overall objective
of deficit reduction.
In the longer term, there may be the
potential to move the BBC towards
a subscription model. This would have a
range of benefits that derive from giving
audiences greater choice and control over
the services they receive and bringing
to bear market pressures that would
strengthen the BBC’s incentives to be
responsive to audiences. However, others
argue that this would undermine the
ability of the BBC to deliver such a wide
range of quality public service content.
Without some element of public subsidy
the BBC incentives would be more
commercial and as such we would expect
output to prioritise commercial return
rather than social benefit.

101

Funding model

There is also a question of feasibility and
cost. As new technologies make it easier
for content providers to control access
to broadcast content, the feasibility
of a subscription model increases. But
this could not be implemented quickly.
A transition to full subscription would
need to happen over a number of years
and would need collaboration between
Government and industry in order to
prepare, particularly concerning the rollout of conditional access technology.
We are therefore minded to consider
this as an option for the longer term, and
would welcome views on this through
Charter Review.

102

Funding models
There are three options that are generally
thought to be most viable for introduction
in the short to medium-term.
These are explored in the table below:
− a reformed licence fee;
− a universal public funding model,
similar to the German ‘media levy’; and
− a combination of public funding and
subscription.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Funding models for the BBC
Option
Retain but reform the
licence fee
The licence fee would be
retained but reformed to close
the ‘iPlayer loophole’.

Strengths and weaknesses
− Retains the advantages of the current system.
− Removes the anomaly of the iPlayer loophole, ensuring
the BBC’s income is protected given future trends in
consumption (this is discussed in a separate section
on page 106).
− Maintains an element of choice – currently only those who
consume live TV need to purchase a licence. This option
would continue to provide people with the choice to
opt-out of buying a licence if they do not consume live TV.
However, some of these individuals may consume radio
or online content funded through the licence fee which
does not require a licence and are therefore receiving this
service without contributing to its costs.
− Maintains a ﬂat rate compulsory levy which is regressive.
− The TV Licence Fee Enforcement Review (see page 106)
recommends no change to the current enforcement
regime (while the licence fee collection mechanism
remains in place) as it is broadly fair and proportionate.
However, it concludes that enforcement remains difficult
given the need to prove that live TV is being consumed.
It also recommends consideration of changes to the
iPlayer loophole.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

103

Funding model

Option
Universal household levy
One option that has gained
much attention recently, and
which the Culture, Media and
Sport Select Committee alighted
on as the most promising
option in their Future of the BBC
report, is a universal household
levy.78 This is based on the
German model under which
all households pay a fee for
provision of media, including TV,
radio, online and on demand
content. Concessions could
be put in place, for example,
to provide those in single
occupancy households with the
option to pay a lower fee.

Strengths and weaknesses
− Removes the anomaly of the iPlayer loophole, as the levy
would be paid by all households (subject to concessions
and exemptions) regardless of the method by which they
consume BBC content.
− Supports the concept of a universal service and better
reﬂects the services funded, directly linking public funding
to radio, online and other services, rather than just TV.
− Could be used to address the regressive elements of the
licence fee.
− Under this option all households contribute to BBC
services regardless of whether they consume BBC content.
However, circa 97 per cent of individuals consume
BBC content.79
− This would broaden the base of people paying for the
BBC and therefore potentially allow for a reduction in the
licence fee or increased investment in content.
− May be costly to implement.
− The TV Licence Fee Enforcement Review concluded that
changing the method of collection could involve changing
the method of enforcement, including reconsidering the
case for decriminalisation of TV licence evasion. It also
noted that a universal levy would meet many of the
concerns which stand in the way of reform of the current
enforcement regime.

104

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Option
Mixed public funding and
subscription
There are several options for
a mixed public funding and
subscription model. The public
funding element could retain
the licence fee at some level,
or move to a levy as described
above. The subscription element
could then be applied to
certain elements of the wider
BBC portfolio, for example by
funding a ‘core service’ through
the licence fee with a premium
subscription top-up or by
making iPlayer a subscriptiononly service.

Strengths and weaknesses
− Provides greater choice over consumption for audiences.
− The BBC may not be able to provide ‘something for
everyone’ as it is currently does.
− Subscription for premium services may be more expensive
than is the case under the current model and generate
only a small saving to the licence fee payer.
− ‘Core service’ vs. ‘premium’ packages may be difficult to
determine with wide-ranging views on what should be
included in the core package.
− Consideration would need to be given to the availability
of conditional access and other technology to enable
subscriptions to be collected from all viewers. For example,
this would be relatively simple to implement for online
services using existing pay-wall technology, however, for
TV services, a major infrastructure roll-out would need to
occur to allow subscription to be possible. This would take
a number of years and have a significant costs associated
with it.
− May be costly to implement.
− The TV Licence Fee Enforcement Review concluded that
changing the method of collection could involve changing
the method of enforcement, including reconsidering the
case for decriminalisation of TV licence evasion.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

105

Funding model

iPlayer loophole

This presents four problems:

One area where Government is
committed to reform is the so-called
‘iPlayer loophole’. Whatever BBC services
are consumed (radio, online, on demand),
a TV licence is currently only required
to watch television services that are
broadcast live.80 This means a licence is not
required to watch on demand or catch-up
services.81 It is estimated that 0.5 million
people, around 2 per cent, legally watch
on demand or catch-up programmes (on
iPlayer and other services) but do not pay
the licence fee.82 It is likely this figure will
grow as more people choose to watch
on demand only. Mediatique forecasts
estimate that the TV share of on demand
and time-shifted content will double
from its current 12 per cent to almost
25 per cent of all viewing by 2017.83

1. Money – if more people watch BBC
programmes on demand without a TV
licence (as is currently legal), the BBC’s
income declines.

106

2. Fairness – use of the iPlayer loophole
to avoid paying the licence fee is unfair
as licence fee payers are footing the bill
for providing content that people only
watching on demand get to enjoy.
3. Enforcement – the ability to deter
evasion is increasingly constrained by
the proliferation of non-traditional TV
receivers such as tablets and mobiles as
it is easier to conceal these (or to claim
legitimate use of them) from TV Licensing
enforcement officers.
4. Clarity and simplicity – the
proliferation of devices combined with the
iPlayer loophole risks creating confusion
among the public as to who should be
paying for a TV licence.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

The Government has committed to
bringing forward legislation in the next
year to modernise the licence fee in
order to cover public service broadcast
catch-up TV.84 The Charter Review will
need to consider how to implement this
commitment both in the short-term,
under the current licence fee model,
and in the future, under any of the
alternative models.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

There are a number of ways in which
this could operate. Charter Review will
also need to consider the practicalities
of enforcement of such changes to the
licence fee model, and how this change
will relate to any alternative funding
models. Government would welcome
views on this issue as part of this
consultation.

107

Funding model

Enforcement of
the funding model
The TV Licence Fee Enforcement Review,
‘Perry Review’ was announced in
September 2014 to consider whether
the sanctions currently in place for TV
licence evasion are appropriate and fair,
and whether the regime represents
good value for licence fee payers and
taxpayers. This was prompted by concerns
that the criminal nature of the current
regime is not a proportionate response
to the problem of TV licence evasion.
And an independent review was duly
commissioned from David Perry QC.
The Perry Review concluded that there
should be no fundamental change in
the sanctions regime as it applies to the
current licence fee collection system. It
found that the current regime represents
a broadly fair and proportionate response
to the problem of TV licence evasion and
provides good value for money (both for
licence fee payers and taxpayers).

108

The Perry Review did, however, make
several recommendations towards
improving the current regime, including
urgent consideration of the ‘iPlayer
loophole’. It is to be noted that the
Perry Review specifically focused on
enforcement within the current licence
fee collection framework. It noted that
“should there be any change in the
method of collection… a move to another
method of enforcement will become
more practicable and the question
of decriminalisation will again fall for
consideration”.85
The Charter Review will need to consider
the recommendations of the TV Licence
Fee Enforcement Review and their
applicability to both the current, and
alternative funding models.

Question 11
How should we pay for the BBC
and how should the licence fee be
modernised?

Box 19: What the licence fee funds
The licence fee is used to fund
the whole range of BBC services:

57 radio stations

9 television channels

iPlayer and Red Button

BBC World Service

BBC Online

In addition the licence fee also funds
some other services and projects including:

S4C (the Welsh Public
Service Broadcaster)

110

Local TV

Broadband
infrastructure roll-out

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

There are two key issues when
discussing what the licence fee funds.
Firstly, what areas of activity it should
fund and secondly, whether any of
these activities should have their level
of funding protected. Both will need
to be considered in the BBC’s funding
settlement.
The BBC has previously agreed to the
use of the licence fee beyond the direct
delivery of its services and channels,
for a range of projects and programmes
in support of public purposes. The 2010
licence fee settlement agreed a range
of activities that the licence fee would
fund including: the World Service, BBC
Monitoring, S4C (the Welsh language
Public Service Broadcaster), local
television infrastructure roll-out and
content,90 and the roll-out of superfast
broadband through Broadband Delivery
UK91. Most recently, the BBC agreed to
fund the cost of free TV licences for the
over 75s at the 2015 Summer Budget. The
BBC will also take on responsibility for
how this concession should be set in the
next parliament. Through the course of

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

Charter Review we will need to consider
the practical steps needed to transfer
this responsibility, including appropriate
governance arrangements.
These, and other previous uses of the
licence fee have, for example, supported
the roll-out of digital infrastructure, the
uptake of new technologies such as digital
switchover, and public policy objectives
such as helping more people to ‘get online’
and the provision of regional news and
content. This Government is committed
to continuing to fund the initiatives
that will allow the media industry to
grow and innovate and believes that it
is appropriate for the licence fee (or an
alternative funding model) to fund such
commitments.92 Through Charter Review
we want to discuss how the BBC’s public
policy objectives might continue to be
supported in this way, (for example
by supporting digital radio switchover
or regional news and content).

111

Protected uses of licence fee funds

In previous licence fee settlements the
Government has also asked the BBC
to commit to funding some things at
a specific level (a ringfenced amount)
to ensure the ongoing protection of
funding for that service. Most recently
this has included funding for S4C, local
television and the World Service (see
Box 19 on page 110 and Box 20 right).
While ﬂexibility is an advantage for
managing budgets, in some instances
there is a particular reason to ensure
a minimum level of funding to ensure
certain services are protected. In the next
funding settlement the Government will
need to consider what services should be
protected and we welcome views on this
issue as part of this consultation.

112

Box 20: World Service
The World Service continues to be
valued across the world for accurate,
impartial and independent news, but it
has faced challenges over this Charter
period. As a result of decreased funding
and the need to respond to changing
audience needs, 15 language services
closed, radio programming in a number
of languages ended, and there has been
a reduction in short-wave and mediumwave distribution. Despite this, the World
Service has continued to thrive. It has
launched Arabic and Persian TV services,
and now provides TV, radio and online
content in 29 language services and its
audience has continued to increase, now
standing at 210 million people.93

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

But the context within which the World
Service operates is changing. There
is increased competition from other
international providers such as Russian
and Chinese state broadcasters, and
new research suggests that digital
news is dominated by a few successful
brands with others struggling to reach
a wider audience.94 We want to look
at how this important part of the
BBC’s service can continue to compete
with other international providers and
remain relevant in a changing global
environment.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

Funding for the World Service transferred
to the licence fee during the last
Charter and the BBC chose to increase
its operating licence expenditure to
£254 million in 2014-15.95 Funding levels
for 2015-16 are still to be confirmed.
Making sure the World Service continues
to have the funding it needs will be vital
to allow it to continue to deliver value
for the UK.

113

Protected uses of licence fee funds

Contestable funding
Currently the vast majority of licence
fee income is spent on BBC services.
In a world with increasing provision
and diversity of media services, and with
other broadcasters providing content and
services with public service characteristics
(for example, UK originated news, drama,
documentaries, arts, and children’s
programming), the Charter Review should
consider whether there is a case for
alternative providers to be able to access
an element of this funding. For example,
children’s programming is an area in
which the BBC has a near monopoly, as
highlighted in the most recent Ofcom
PSB Review, and a small amount of
contestable funding could introduce
greater diversity of providers and greater
plurality in public services provision. The
principle of contestable funding was
previously recommended by the Burns
Panel, which advised the previous Charter
Review process.

114

This money could still be available to
the BBC to compete for, or could be
solely for other providers, including via
a match-funding arrangement. In either
circumstance an alternative organisation
would need to be identified to oversee the
administration and governance of such
a funding pot. This could be the BBC’s
regulator or an alternative organisation.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Contestable funding
Advantages

Disadvantages

− introduces an element of competition,
pushing the BBC and other PSBs to be

− could improve plurality of supply for
key genres; and

Value for money
and efﬁciency
The BBC is accountable to the
licence fee payer for providing good
value for the funding it receives.96
Over the Charter period there has
been extensive public debate of the
BBC’s efficiency record and value
for money. It is right that in Charter
Review this is scrutinised.
Following the 2010 funding settlement,
the BBC, like many other public bodies,
has had to make significant savings. The
settlement resulted in the BBC taking on
a number of new responsibilities while
the licence fee remained frozen at £145.50
until 2016-17. These factors, set against
growing revenues from a larger number
of households and commercial services,
resulted in the BBC needing to achieve
a 16 per cent cash-releasing efficiency
target over four years. The BBC responded
to the funding settlement with a major
efficiency initiative (Delivering Quality
First), setting a target of £700 million of
annual recurring savings by the end of
2016-17 compared to a 2011-12 baseline.

116

Box 21: Headline efﬁciency
savings by the BBC
The main ways in which the BBC has
found savings in the last years are in
payroll bills, procurement, estates, IT
and content reductions. For example,
the Corporation cut staff costs by
17 per cent in real terms between
2011-12 and 2013-14 and the number of
senior managers has fallen by 14 per cent
since 2011, from 477 to 410; though
in the first two years of Delivering
Quality First there has only been a small
reduction in headcount (1 per cent).97
An example of how these savings have
played out in the television division, a
division with particularly large planned
savings under Delivering Quality First,
is set out opposite.98 This breakdown
shows that the largest proportion of
the savings in the year 2013-14 were
delivered through scope savings, where
the BBC is doing less, followed by
changes to contract management
and production costs.

Value for money and efﬁciency

The National Audit Office found in its
assessment of Delivering Quality First
that the BBC has so far found a range
of means to deliver against its efficiency
targets (see Box 21 on page 116/117).
While progress has been made, the BBC’s
record over the Charter period also shows
up a number of instances where licence
fee payers’ money has not been used well,
or where questions of value for money
have been raised. For example:
− £100 million of licence fee income
was spent by the BBC on its Digital
Media Initiative, which aimed to deliver
technology to allow BBC staff to
develop, create, and share broadcast
video and other content from desktop
computers. The initiative failed, and
delivered no tangible assets, and
the National Audit Office noted, for
example, that ‘the executive board
applied insufficient scrutiny...’.99

118

− Questions have been raised about the
way in which the BBC has modernised
parts of its estate. For example, the
£1 billion refurbishment100 of the
Broadcasting House complex in London,
according to the National Audit Office,
has far higher benchmarked running
costs than similar buildings.101
− While the BBC recently capped
severance payments for all staff at
£150,000, this move came only after
significant parliamentary pressure about
the size and scale of BBC severance
pay-offs over the Charter period,
some of which went beyond what was
contractually required of the BBC.102
− In many respects senior remuneration
at the BBC compares favourably with
other broadcasters. For example, the
Director General of the BBC received a
total package of £466,000103 in 2014-15
compared to the Chief Executive of

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

ITV who received a total package of
£4.4 million in 2014.104 But the BBC’s
annual report shows that at least 74
members of staff are paid more than
the Prime Minister105 and total numbers
employed, unlike in many other parts
of the public sector, have not reduced
significantly.106

− When considering the BBC Three and
BBC One+1 proposals recently, the BBC
Trust had to balance value for money
concerns with potential market impacts.
However it could be argued that where
spare capacity for channels is available
or unused, there may be other ways of
delivering value for licence fee payers
(see Box 22 below).

Box 22: BBC Three and BBC One +1
proposals – greater value for money?
The BBC Trust recently considered
proposals from the Executive to move
BBC Three online-only, realising savings
to devote to drama content, and
launching a ‘BBC One+1’ service.107
While the BBC Three proposal was
accepted by the Trust, subject to certain
conditions and further consultation,
the decision was taken not to agree the
BBC One+1 service, given the potential
impacts on the wider market.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

Questions remain, however, over
whether the multiplex108 capacity which
the BBC had intended to use for the
new BBC One +1 service could deliver
greater benefits, for example through
an alternative public service use, or
through being made available for use by
commercial broadcasters.

119

Value for money and efﬁciency

While the licence fee is cheaper than most
pay TV bundles (costing £12 a month
compared to commercial competitors
which typically start from around
£20 a month), views on the value for
money of the licence fee remain mixed.
Latest figures from the BBC show that
57 per cent of respondents said that the
licence fee was good value, and there
has been little change to this score over
the Charter period.109 The proportion
rises with the number of services used:
66 per cent of those who use all three
BBC platforms (TV, online, and radio)
reported that the BBC offers good value
for money.110

There are significant differences in the
perception of the BBC’s value for money
across regions. In the same 2014 survey
60 per cent of Welsh respondents agreed
that the BBC offers them good value
for money, followed by 58 per cent in
England, 50 per cent in Scotland and
47 per cent in Northern Ireland. Different
ethnic groups also have significantly
different views: 58 per cent among
white audiences agree that the licence
fee offers value for money compared to
just 47 per cent among Black, Asian and
Minority Ethnic audiences.111

The BBC’s
commercial activities
The BBC makes and commissions
content that is popular not just
with audiences in the UK, but
around the world. The current
Charter enables the BBC to carry
out a range of commercial activities
to make money that can be
invested back into its programming.
However, it has been given constraints:
any commercial activity must fit with the
public purposes, be commercially efficient,
not endanger the BBC’s reputation and
brand and follow fair trading rules.
The BBC’s commercial activities are
conducted through the BBC’s largest
subsidiary, BBC Worldwide. BBC
Worldwide is the world’s largest TV
distributor outside the large US studios,112
and markets BBC content both in the UK
and in the rest of the world. It generates
revenues of around £1 billion per year.
The BBC also generates £90 million
of sales through Global News, which

122

operates BBC.com around the world,
and £30 million through BBC Studios
and Post Production, which rents out
BBC production space. In the last year
Worldwide returned £227 million to the
Corporation.113 Together with in-house
produced content, Worldwide thereby
supports independent producers of
BBC-commissioned content who through
BBC Worldwide can access the scale and
reach of the BBC’s global marketing.
In determining the best way of returning
value to the Corporation, BBC Worldwide
has tested different strategies. BBC
Worldwide profits have grown since
the beginning of the Charter period with
significant international successes such
as Sherlock, Doctor Who, Strictly Come
Dancing, and Dancing with the Stars,
which has been exported to over 50
countries.114 However, not all decisions
were successful, for example, Worldwide
acquired and subsequently divested itself
of Lonely Planet, a travel guide book
publisher, at a significant loss. Worldwide

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

has now narrowed its portfolio of
activities and concentrates on marketing
BBC content.
A recurring issue for BBC Worldwide’s
global strategy is its ability to access
finance: as it is subject to public bodies’
spending rules, BBC Worldwide has a
Government-imposed borrowing limit
of £350 million. This, some have argued,
acts as a brake on BBC Worldwide’s ability
to develop larger overseas markets such
as the US.
As global audiences continue to expand,
so too do the opportunities for driving
growth in revenue. Clearly, making the
most of existing BBC programming is
a good thing, and can help the BBC
continue to invest in high quality content.
However, there are other factors to
consider. It is important for UK licence
fee payers that BBC output is not driven
solely by the consideration of its retail
value in international markets. Equally,
the impact that the sale of BBC

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

intellectual property has on other UK
broadcasters and producers, who may
also be seeking to market British content
to an international audience, must
be given serious consideration. In this
context, Charter Review will consider the
full range of options for reforming the
BBC’s commercial operations, including
full or part privatisation of Worldwide.

Question 14
How should the BBC’s commercial
operations, including BBC
Worldwide, be reformed?

BBC governance
and regulation
Good governance and regulation
are vital to a successful BBC. It is
what makes sure the BBC does
what it is meant to. It means
building the right framework of
accountability, incentives, checks
and balances necessary to make
sure the BBC delivers for licence fee
payers, takes account of its market
impact, spends its money wisely
and is held to account in doing so.

Getting this framework right is vitally
important – but it is not enough on its
own. The BBC also needs the right people,
behaviours and organisational culture to
thrive. Good governance and regulation
are a precondition but not a guarantee for
the future success of the BBC.
This section therefore looks at:
− The current model; and
− Options for reform.
It also looks at a range of wider
governance issues:
− Service Licences and Public Value Tests;
− Public and democratic accountability;
and
− Royal Charter.

Box 23: How the Trust model came about
Until 2007 the BBC had a Board of
Governors who were responsible for
acting as trustees of the public interest
by overseeing any complaints, approving
the BBC’s strategic direction, appointing
the Director General and ensuring that
BBC management implemented its
strategy. The Secretary of State was
responsible for approving new services.
This model came under some criticism,
particularly that the Board of Governors
were expected to be both a ‘cheerleader’
and ‘critic’ of the BBC, a model that
led to a lack of clarity between the
governance and regulatory functions
and was ultimately unsustainable.
This led some to a perception that the
BBC had not been run in the interests
of the licence fee payer and that the
arrangements did not have sufficient
transparency and accountability.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

In 2005, an independent panel,
chaired by Lord Burns, appointed by
the Government recommended that
the Board of Governors should be
replaced by an independent Public
Service Broadcasting Commission (PSBC).
The recommendation was that the PSBC
would advise Ministers on the level of
the licence fee as well as taking over the
regulatory responsibilities held by the
Governors and operating a contestable
element of the licence fee. The Panel
also recommended the creation of a
unitary board. This recommendation was
rejected by the then Secretary of State
who instead introduced the Trust model.

127

The current model

The BBC is a unique organisation
and the last Charter created
a model of governance and
regulation aimed at addressing
the shortcomings of the previous
model of a Board of Governors
(see Box 23 on page 131) while
respecting the independence of the
BBC. The result of this was the Trust
model. There were also a number
of other innovations, such as Public
Value Tests and Service Licences,
and improvements in areas like
transparency and complaints which
are discussed in later sections.

128

There are three key groups that make up
the current system of governance and
regulation of the BBC: the BBC Trust, the
BBC Executive and Ofcom.
The BBC Trust is, as described above,
the sovereign body of the BBC. It is
currently chaired by Rona Fairhead who,
as Chairman of the Trust, may also be
known as Chairman of the BBC. The
overriding aims of the BBC Trust are to act
as stewards of the licence fee, guardians
of the public interest and to promote the
public purposes. In doing this the Trust
is responsible for setting the strategic
direction of the BBC, approving the highlevel strategy and budgets for services,
and holding the Executive to account

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

in delivering this. This means it sets out
what each service should do, decides
how they should be assessed, monitors
compliance and approves any changes.
The Trust operates independently from
the Executive with separate staff and
budget – 61.8 full time equivalent staff
and expenditure of £10 million115
in 2014-15.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

129

The current model

The Executive Board is made up of a mix
of Executive and Non-Executive members
with a Chairman who can either be a nonexecutive or the Director General. Since
the creation of the current governance
model the Chairman of the Executive
Board has in practice been the Director
General (currently Tony Hall). The role of
the Executive Board is, in short, to run the
BBC. It is responsible for delivering the
BBC’s services, its editorial and creative
output, and management of the BBC.
It does all of this in line with the strategies
and priorities set by the Trust.

The role of Ofcom in relation to BBC
governance and regulation is important.
As the regulator responsible for the wider
broadcasting and telecommunications
landscape it has a variety of
responsibilities that relate to the BBC
both directly and in terms of setting the
wider framework. Key among these are
its regulation of broadcast content (for
example in relation to issues such as
harm and offence), handling complaints
on these issues, being consulted on the
setting of quotas, and its role in Market
Impact Assessments – some of these
areas are addressed later in this section.
This current Governance model has
some important advantages. In clearly
separating the role of the BBC Trust
and the Executive, with separate staff,
finances and public reporting, the
regulatory elements of the Trust’s role are
at greater distance from the Executive
than they were under the Governor’s
model. This has helped to improve the
rigour with which the BBC can be held
to account. Giving the BBC Trust explicit

130

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

responsibility for representing licence
fee payers recognises the importance of
their interests and the Trust has over the
last Charter period developed a range of
mechanisms for engagement with the
public. Through the introduction of a
variety of mechanisms and tools the Trust
has made sure the BBC’s decisions are
given improved scrutiny.
However, over the course of this Charter
there have been a range of issues which
critics suggest are symptomatic of
ineffective governance structures:
− failed delivery of major projects such
as the Digital Media Initiative;
− serious editorial failings, such as the
cancelled report on Jimmy Savile
and the Newsnight/Lord McAlpine
allegations; and

These concerns led to a review of BBC
internal governance in 2013 which
recommended changes to the way
the governance principles were put into
practice. However, many, including the
new Chairman of the BBC Trust,116 and
the Culture, Media and Sport Select
Committee report on the future of the
BBC117 have gone further, proposing that
more fundamental reform may be needed
to address systemic problems with the
existing model. Criticisms remain that
the Trust is conﬂicted as both regulator
of and cheerleader for the BBC. The
distinction between the Trust and the
Executive, while set out in Charter, is not
well understood or articulated. There are
also suggestions that in the current model
the Trust might lack the necessary powers
and sanctions to effect change.

− lack of clarity about responsibilities and
insufficient scrutiny by the Executive
and the Trust, as demonstrated by
excessive severance payments to
senior staff.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

131

Options for reform

There is a range of options
for reforming the model of
governance and regulation.
The three strategic options are:
− a model based on the Trust;
− a new standalone regulatory
organisation (such as the Public
Service Broadcasting Commission
set out in the Culture, Media and
Sport Select Committee Report);
and
− moving more regulation to Ofcom
while abolishing the Trust.
The latter two options would likely
see the BBC having a unitary board,
which would set the strategy and be
responsible for delivery, with an external
body or bodies performing regulatory
functions. All options have their benefits
and weaknesses as set out below. In
addition to this strategic question there
will be many decisions about where
responsibilities for specific elements of
governance and regulation will need to sit.

132

Reformed Trust model
The first option is to retain the current
framework, but to reform it further by:
− Clarifying roles – despite the formal
structures, the separation of the Trust
and Executive has not always been
clear, and the wider public does not
understand the division. This is often
seen as contributing to the problems
the BBC has had in dealing with some
of the challenges it faced in the last
Charter. Some of the confusion, both
real and perceived, could be resolved by
making clear the distinction between
the BBC Executive and the Trust, further
clarifying responsibilities, and including
the monitoring of the division of
responsibilities as an obligation.
− Strengthening the strategic function
of the Trust – one criticism sometimes
levelled at the Trust is that while it
approves the BBC’s formal strategy,
it is too passive in setting the strategic
direction of the organisation. Rather
than being the driving force of what
licence fee payers want, it is instead

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

seen as reacting to changes led by
the Executive, as was shown with the
proposal to add video to BBC Radio 1,
or move BBC Three online. This could
be resolved by changing the specific
responsibilities of the Trust and how it
relates to the Executive, or indeed by
introducing specific mechanisms that
would mean the Trust taking a more
active role in setting the strategy for
the BBC.
− Strengthening powers of
enforcement – the Trust has a range
of mechanisms for holding the
Executive to account. Strengthening
these in any way, for example by
giving the Trust the ability to withhold
funding, might help improve the
effective regulation of the BBC.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

An approach that modifies the existing
system brings certain advantages over
more radical reforms. All organisational
change takes time, costs money and
introduces disruption, risk and uncertainty.
Smaller changes to the current system
would reduce these risks and increase
confidence in outcomes. It is also worth
noting that the Trust is less than a decade
old and with more time, and some of
the structural changes suggested above,
it might be able to reform further and
address some of the criticisms levelled
at it. But there are also substantial
drawbacks to this approach. However
far the roles of the Trust and Executive
are clarified, the structure retains a
fundamental tension in requiring the
Trust to act as a regulatory body while
remaining part of the BBC. With even
the Chairman of the Trust describing a
move from the Trust model to an external
regulator as a front runner, it is clear that
there is a case for more radical change.

133

Models of governance and regulation

Standalone regulator model
The notion of a standalone regulator
model is used here to represent a range of
options that each have a similar structure,
sometimes referred to as ‘OfBeeb’. Their
common feature is a second body –
completely distinct from the BBC and
Ofcom – that performs some or all of
the oversight and regulatory functions
that currently sit with the Trust. Most
commonly, this model sees the BBC
adopting a unitary board which would
consolidate the strategy setting and
responsibility for operational delivery –
although some of the strategic elements
of this function could sit in the distinct
body. An approach of this kind was the
option that the original Burns report
in 2006 and the Culture, Media and
Sport Select Committee report in 2015
recommended.

134

In moving regulation to an external body
fully separated in both structure and
title from the BBC, this model removes
much of the criticism about the conﬂict
of being both regulator and cheerleader.
It could also bring all of the key strategic
and operational responsibilities together
in a unitary board, with very clear lines of
accountability and a strong non-executive
membership that can ensure the
interests of the British public are properly
represented. A standalone regulator would
also not risk being distracted by wider
responsibilities.
But this model is not without its
challenges. Single purpose regulators
are difficult to set up in a way that does
not lead to their being either overly
dependent on or confrontational with the
organisation they regulate, as historical
examples, such as the Postal Services
Commission (Postcomm) regulation of
Royal Mail, demonstrate. A structure set
up to regulate from outside the BBC may
also struggle with being too far removed
– unable to inﬂuence the decision making
of a powerful unitary board.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

There is also a significant risk that this
would confuse the regulatory landscape
by dividing media and telecoms
responsibilities in an increasingly
converging sector. This would be
exacerbated if the regulator were given
any additional responsibilities relating to
public service broadcasting.
The detail of exactly what responsibilities
and powers sit within this regulator would
be up for debate and there are a range of
proposals that could give the body strong
powers. This could either be through
changing the balance of responsibilities
that this regulatory body and Ofcom
have, or by giving the body responsibility
for other decisions such as the allocation
of any contestable funding (explored
further in Chapter 3).

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

Ofcom
Ofcom is a well respected independent
regulator with a strong track record, which
is why it has been suggested by some
that it could take on a greater role in the
regulation of the BBC. The third option
is therefore for the regulatory function
to move to Ofcom with the delivery and
governance functions likely residing with
a unitary board. A version of this proposal
was considered as an option in the Burns
Report at the last Charter Review, and was
revisited in the recent Culture, Media and
Sport Select Committee Report.
This option would be similar in many
ways to a standalone regulator. The
specific ways in which Ofcom would
need to change in order to execute
such a role depend on the specific
responsibilities it acquired but it would
likely require significant extra resources
and could involve additional structures
within Ofcom itself such as independent
advisory boards.

135

Models of governance and regulation

This option is attractive because Ofcom
is already known to be an effective
regulator, and it fully understands
the broadcast and wider media and
telecommunications sector. The cost
and disruption of moving responsibilities
to Ofcom would likely be lower than
the creation of an entirely new body.
Such a move would consolidate media
and telecommunications regulatory
responsibilities within a single body which
has the benefit of simplicity and clarity,
particularly within converging sectors. In
clearly dividing governance and regulation
in this way this model also effectively
removes any potential conﬂict of interest.

136

However, there are also difficulties. The
scale of this kind of activity could involve
significant disruption which would need
to be mitigated both for the BBC and
potentially for Ofcom. While Ofcom
does undertake measures of public value,
it does not currently approve particular
services. This change could also be seen as
making Ofcom too powerful, expanding
its already large remit and expenditure.
Last year Ofcom had a budget of
£117 million and nearly 800 staff.118

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

With all three models there is a question
of who the governing body is ultimately
accountable to. Under the current system
this is the licence fee payer, described in
such a way to encompass public interest
more broadly. There are merits to this
approach – it explicitly ties the thinking
of the organisation to those who pay
for it and provides a very clear link of
accountability. However, we may want to
think differently about this. Representing
the public interest is a complex task –
differentiating between the interests of
audiences, special interest groups, and
society at large, and taking into account
the benefits not just for those who
consume the BBC’s content, but the UK
as a whole. There is also clearly a need
to consider the implications should the
funding model change, as discussed in
Chapter 3.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

Question 15
How should the current model of
governance and regulation for the
BBC be reformed?

137

Models of governance and regulation

Box 24: Governance framework
To make informed decisions about
the best approach to governance and
regulation there needs to be a clear
understanding of what it is trying to
achieve and a framework for assessing
this. A proposed framework is set out
below. There are some principles of
good governance which apply to all
organisations. The BBC is no exception
and already reports against these
principles – codified in The UK Corporate
Governance Code – in its Annual Report
and Accounts. There are, however, some
differences. This is why we are proposing
an assessment framework that includes
both general and BBC specific principles
as well as taking into account the cost
and delivery to ensure value for money
for the public.

138

General governance principles
− Leadership: clear roles and
responsibilities.
− Effectiveness: balance of skills and
experience. Appropriate appointment
and evaluation processes.
− Accountability: transparency, risk
management and internal control
systems. Relationship with auditors.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

BBC speciﬁc principles
− Public accountability: accountable
to the public as equivalent to
shareholders, including transparency.
− Sensitive to market impact:
mechanisms to ensure any impact
is understood and justified.

Practical issues
− Value for money: governance model
represents good value for the public.
− Deliverable: proportionate and
appropriate governance model
taking into account risk and cost
of implementation.

− Independence: free from editorial
interference.
− Regulation: appropriate regulatory
framework.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

139

Service Licences
and Public Value Tests
The Charter Review process is an
opportunity to set the framework
for what we want the BBC to
do and how it should do it. But
there will undoubtedly be key
decisions at other points in time.
The last Charter put in place new
mechanisms to ensure any changes
properly reﬂect the public interest
and take due account of market
impact. These were Service Licences
and Public Value Tests (PVTs).

The Service Licences set out what each
service does and how, for example the
BBC 1 licence sets out that it should be
‘…the BBC’s most popular mixed-genre
television service across the UK, offering
a wide range of high quality programmes,’
and ‘…the BBC’s primary outlet for major
UK and international events and it should
reﬂect the whole of the UK in its output’.
Service Licences are reviewed at least
twice each Charter period. Each review
involves consultation with industry and
the public to ensure each service is still
meeting the needs of licence fee payers.
The PVTs are the mechanism by which
any significant changes proposed to
services are assessed. They are usually
in response to proposals from the BBC
Executive and have two key parts:
− an assessment of public value
undertaken by the Trust and involving
significant consultation with the public
and industry; and
− a Market Impact Assessment (MIA)
undertaken by Ofcom on behalf of the
BBC Trust which seeks to understand
and explain any impact on the market
that the proposed changes might have.

140

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Together these allow the BBC Trust to
take a fully informed view of the costs
and benefits of the proposed change.
The subsequent decision can have
material effects on the services audiences
receive, as with, for example, the recent
provisional decision of the Trust to
approve the proposal for BBC Three to
move online but to reject the proposal
for a BBC +1 channel. The introduction
of these processes has been broadly
welcomed and is a significant step
forward, however there may be the
potential to strengthen the overall system
by addressing some of the criticisms that
have been made:
− The PVT can be too blunt an
instrument, it is a single, relatively
costly and time consuming process
applied once proposals cross a
threshold of relevance. It is therefore
not always able to react to changes
effectively; either taking too long
to deliver or missing a change
that did not meet the threshold of
significance. This can be exacerbated
by the time it can take for the Trust to
receive a proposal.
BBC Charter Review: public consultation

− The use of PVTs is reactive, looking
at a proposal in isolation rather than
taking a view of the BBC as a whole
and the role that each service should
play within it.
− The Service Licences, while increasing
the level of scrutiny and control may
not hold the BBC to a high enough
standard or contain enough specific
details about output.
− The mechanisms for enforcement of
Service Licence reviews may not be
sufficiently robust. For example, there
have been industry complaints that
recommendations about the average
listening age of the BBC’s most
popular radio stations have not been
adequately enforced.119

Question 16
How should Public Value Tests and
Service Licences be reformed and
who should have the responsibility
for making these decisions?

141

Public accountability

In addition to the overall
governance and regulatory models
and how changes are made during
Charter we need to consider
whether the direct accountability
of the BBC should be reformed.

There are three main forms of
direct public accountability:
− Research and Audience Councils;
− transparency; and
− complaints handling

Research and Audience Councils
One of the main ways in which the
BBC engages with the public is through
its programme of research. Some of
this is done ‘in-house’, but much is
commissioned from independent experts,
polling and research organisations.
It looks at all aspects of the BBC – TV,
radio, and internet as well as editorial
issues, the BBC as an organisation and
different audience groups. The Trust also
undertakes a wide range of consultations
to inform decisions it is taking.
One of the main ways in
which the BBC engages
with the public is through
its programme of research.

142

Audience Councils are a further way of
providing a direct link between licence
fee payers and the Trust. There is an
Audience Council for each nation in the
UK. Each feeds into their BBC Trust Board

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

representative. These councils provide
insights into what audiences want and
expect from the BBC in their nations, and
on how well the BBC is doing this. They
also provide an Annual Report to the
Trust. This provides a direct mechanism,
but the system is not very visible to the
public at large and it is unclear what the
impact of these councils has been on the
overall operation of the BBC.

Transparency
Transparency is a second key method
for ensuring the BBC is acting in the
best interests of the public and other
stakeholders. Despite concerns around lack
of transparency within the BBC, there have
been a number of improvements over the
last Charter. The BBC proactively publishes:
− executive pay and expenses;
− the minutes of BBC Trust meetings;
− details of planned changes in its public
consultations and services;
− Service Licences; and
− protocols for how it operates.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

The BBC is also subject to the Freedom
of Information (FOI) Act (except for
information held for the purposes of
journalism, art or literature). These sources
of information help civil society and the
wider media hold the BBC to account.
Stories about the BBC, often derived from
transparency reporting or FOI requests,
are regular features in many national
newspapers, such as the Daily Mail’s
reporting of training costs at the BBC120
or the Telegraph’s reporting of IT thefts.121
However, there are elements of the BBC
that are not as transparent, particularly
in relation to commercial activities,
and the scale and complexity of the
organisation can make it difficult for
people to understand how decisions are
being made and how and when they can
contribute their views. There are areas
where full transparency may not be
possible for commercial, journalistic or
artistic reasons. But we need to make sure
that the right balance is struck in making
information available in the right way to
build trust with licence fee payers. This
could include looking at the way in which

143

Public accountability

the FOI Act applies to the BBC, whether
a more detailed level of information can
be published (for example, publishing
salaries and staff structures in line with
Government transparency requirements)
and whether more commercial data
could be made available. One area where
transparency is particularly important is
in relation to open and fair competition
through their fair trading rules.

Complaints
In addition, the BBC relates to the
public by listening to what people
have to say when they write to and
call the organisation. The BBC handles
hundreds of thousands of editorial and
general complaints each year (see Box
25 opposite). Editorial complaints make
up the bulk of these and are handled
initially by the BBC audience services
team. Where this does not resolve the
issue it is passed to the division that the
complainant is concerned with. Where
this is still unable to resolve a complaint
it will be escalated to the Editorial
Complaints Unit before being escalated

144

to the Trust and the Editorial Standards
Committee if appropriate. The Committee
regularly publish their decisions and an
overview is provided in the BBC’s Annual
Report. There are separate protocols for
general complaints and indeed complaints
about the Trust itself.122 Ofcom are
responsible for editorial standards
across the broadcasting sector, which
includes the BBC, with an exemption
for impartiality and accuracy which is
handled solely by the BBC Trust. This
means that in many areas there can be
an overlap with both the BBC and Ofcom
having responsibility.
The process for handling complaints has
been reviewed and improved over the last
Charter period with 96 per cent answered
on time in the last year.123 However,
concerns have been expressed around
the dual line of reporting. The BBC and
Ofcom have put in place procedures to
make this dual reporting as streamlined as
possible, however this in itself is not able
to completely remove the duplication.
Some have argued that it might be more
effective to make changes so that one

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

organisation can take responsibility for the
later stages of handling and adjudicating
on all complaints. This could sit within
the BBC, a standalone regulator or Ofcom
so long as they were properly equipped
to do so.

Question 17
How could the BBC improve
engagement with licence fee
payers and the industry, including
through research, transparency and
complaints handling?

Democratic structures

In addition to its direct public
accountability, the BBC is
scrutinised by the democratic
structures in the UK – Government
and Parliament. This is supported
by the role of the National Audit
Office (NAO) in scrutinising its
spending.

The BBC also has accountability to the
devolved nations; for example, following
the Smith Commission, a Memorandum
of Understanding between the UK and
Scottish Governments, the BBC and the
Scottish Parliament has been agreed.
This requires the BBC to lay its Annual
Report and Accounts before the Scottish
Parliament and appear before their
committees on the same basis as for
the UK Parliament. As part of this review
we will consider whether these scrutiny
functions are proving effective, while
safeguarding the BBC’s independence.

Parliamentary Committees
Parliamentary Select Committees are set
up to scrutinise the work of Government
departments and their associated bodies,
including the BBC, on behalf of the
House of Commons and the electorate.
The BBC is most often called before the
Public Accounts Committee (PAC) or the
Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) Select
Committee, the latter also has a role in
conducting a pre-appointment hearing

146

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

for the Chairman of the BBC Trust. The
BBC also lays their Annual Report and
Accounts in the UK Parliament at the end
of every reporting year.
The CMS Select Committee can conduct
inquiries into areas of current interest,
for example in February 2015 it published
the Future of the BBC Report.125 During
the previous Parliament the Committee
conducted four separate inquires into
the BBC and the PAC conducted two.
In addition the BBC was called to give
evidence before several other Select
Committees such as the European
Scrutiny Committee. There is therefore
extensive opportunity for Parliament to
scrutinise the BBC. However, through
Charter Review we would be interested
in views as to whether any improvements
could be made.

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

National Audit Ofﬁce
The NAO conducts value for money
examinations of the BBC, to a
programme agreed with the BBC Trust.
This is a requirement of the Framework
Agreement between the Government and
the BBC and access has been enhanced in
recent years. Recent reports have included
looking at the savings made through
Delivering Quality First (March 2015) and
on Managing the BBC’s estate (January
2015) and have fed into parliamentary
scrutiny. In recent years there have been
calls for the NAO to have statutory
access to the BBC’s accounts, as they
do with other Government departments
and agencies. This would allow the
NAO to audit the BBC’s Annual
Report and Accounts and subject the
Corporation to greater scrutiny. Greater
financial accountability is an important
requirement, which should not undermine
the BBC’s editorial independence.

147

Democratic structures

Government
The BBC is formally independent from
Government, but as a publicly-funded
body its spending is included in the
overall level of public expenditure as
categorised by the Office for National
Statistics. Ordinarily arm’s-length bodies
and other publicly-funded organisations
must conform with controls on their
expenditure and other guidance set out in
HM Treasury’s Managing Public Money.126
At present this is not the case for the BBC,
which has a different framework set out
in the Charter and Framework Agreement
and is regulated by the Trust. This means
that the BBC has different reporting
requirements and financial controls to
other publicly-funded bodies.

148

Because it has a unique model it can
be unclear whether targets designed for
Government departments and agencies
do and should apply to an independent
broadcaster. The function of setting the
BBC’s requirements for accounting for
its public funding is carried out through
the Charter Review and licence fee
settlements and as such we will consider
how the BBC should be treated in respect
of any obligations that might arise in
between these reviews.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Question 18
How should the relationship
between Parliament, Government,
Ofcom, the National Audit Office
and the BBC work?
What accountability structures and
expectations, including financial
transparency and spending controls,
should apply?

BBC Charter Review: public consultation

149

Royal Charter

The BBC has been governed by
a Royal Charter since 1927. The
Charter is the constitutional basis
of the Corporation and guarantees
its independence from Parliament
and Government.

Most of the detail of the operation of
the BBC is then set out in a Framework
Agreement between Government and
the BBC. This includes its purpose remits,
funding, how the Service Licences and
PVTs are supposed to work, regulatory
obligations, complaints handling and its
relationship with Ofcom.
The BBC has been governed

150

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

There is some debate as to whether
a Royal Charter and accompanying
Framework Agreement remain the most
suitable way to enshrine the BBC. There
are many options for reform, among
which the most relevant is the length of
the Charter. There is no set length: there
have been eight Charters which have
varied in length between five and fifteen
years, as well as occasional supplemental
Charters. The most recent two Charters
have both been for ten years.

Question 19
Should the existing approach
of a 10-year Royal Charter and
Framework Agreement continue?

The key trade-off is between the benefits
of certainty and ﬂexibility. Given the
fast-changing media world the relative
costs of being inﬂexible grow. One way
of handling this might be to change
the length of the Charter – reducing it
to a timeframe over which we can be
more certain. Alternatively, it would be
possible to introduce a new mechanism
that provides a point of review mid-way
through a Charter period either to a fixed
timetable or with a relevant trigger.

Under the Communications Act 2003
it is a legal requirement to be in
possession of a valid TV Licence to use
any television-receiving equipment,
such as a television set, digital box,
DVD or video recorder, PC, laptop or
mobile phone, to watch or record TV
programmes as they are being shown
on TV. If a person is only watching on
demand services (e.g. through iPlayer
or other catch-up services), there is no
need for a licence.
A licence is required to watch television
programme services (including delayed
broadcasts) but not on demand services
(services such as iPlayer where access
to the service is on demand i.e. at the
request of the viewer.
