An Agreement Between Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media
and Sport and the British Broadcasting Corporation
THIS DEED is made the 13th September 2011 BETWEEN:
(1) HER MAJESTY’S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR CULTURE, OLYMPICS, MEDIA
AND SPORT (“the Secretary of State”) and
(2) THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION whose chief office is at Broadcasting
House, Portland Place, London W1A 1AA (“the BBC”)
BACKGROUND
(1)

By a deed made on 30th June 2006, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport1
and the BBC entered into an agreement (“the 2006 Agreement”) which is a Framework
Agreement for the purposes of the Royal Charter granted to the BBC on 19th September
2006 (“the Charter”). The 2006 Agreement was amended by further Framework
Agreements made on 23rd March 2010 and 11th February 2011.

(2)

The 2006 Agreement (as so amended) makes provision to complement the Charter.

(3)

By a letter dated 21st October 2010, the Secretary of State confirmed to the BBC the UK
Government’s decision to determine the level of the television licence fee until the end of
March 2017. In that letter, the Secretary of State also confirmed—
a.

that the UK Government will continue to recognise and respect the editorial and
operational independence of the BBC, both as a matter of principle and as an
obligation for the full period of the Charter;

b.

that, for that period, any decision affecting the scale and scope of the BBC’s UK
Public Services and its commercial and other operations will remain a matter for the
BBC Trust;

c.

that the UK Government undertakes to provide a full financial settlement to the end
of the financial year 2016/17 with no new financial requirements or fresh obligations
of any kind being placed on the BBC and/or revenues from the television licence
fee except by mutual agreement;

d.

that the fee for a television licence of a year’s duration authorising colour reception
will remain at £145.50 until the end of 2016/17; and

e.

that the BBC will assume certain additional responsibilities for funding activities
from licence fee revenues, being: assistance to local media companies; the provision
of the World Service and BBC Monitoring services; support for broadband roll-out,
consistent with the BBC’s Public Purposes; and a new partnership and funding
model with S4C, according to the terms set out in the letter.

(4) In the light of the matters set out in that letter, the Secretary of State and the BBC now
agree that they should now conclude this further Framework Agreement, in particular to
make provision appropriate to the new responsibilities to be undertaken by the BBC. Certain
supplementary changes are also made to the 2006 Agreement.
NOW in view of these considerations, THIS DEED WITNESSES that the Secretary of State
and the BBC agree with one another as follows—
The functions and property of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport were transferred to the
Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport (effectively changing the Secretary of State’s official
title) by the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport Order 2010, S.I. 2010/1551.

(1)

Subject to paragraph (2), the 2006 Agreement is amended as specified by clauses 4 to 10
of this Agreement.

(2)

The matters set out in this Agreement are subject to the making of any notification, the
securing of any clearance or exemption and the enactment of any legislative changes
which are necessary in order to enable implementation of such matters (the “enabling
measures”); and the Secretary of State will seek to secure and the BBC will support the
securing of the enabling measures.

INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC SERVICES
4.

The World Service

As from 1st April 2014, for clause 64 substitute—
“64. The World Service
(1)

The BBC must provide the World Service.

(2)

The World Service consists of the broadcast or other distribution of programmes,
and the delivery of services, in English and other languages, aimed primarily at
users outside the UK, and is defined in the Operating Licence issued under clause
64A.

(3)

The BBC shall also transmit World Service output in the UK.

(4)

The Trust will be responsible—

(5)

2

(a)

when setting the overall strategic direction of the BBC, for defining the
position of the World Service within that strategy,

(b)

for approving the budget for the World Service (having regard, in particular,
both to the need to provide sufficient funding for the delivery of the World
Service as it is defined in the Operating Licence and to the interests of licence
fee payers), and

(c)

for assessing the performance of the Executive Board in delivering the World
Service, and holding the Executive Board to account for its performance.

Within the context of the strategy it has set and the budget it has approved, the Trust
will agree with the Foreign Secretary—

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(a)

objectives, priorities and targets for the World Service; and

(b)

the languages in which the World Service is to be provided.

For the purposes of paragraph (5)(a)—
(a)

an “objective” is a medium- to long-term ambition for the World Service,
expressed in general terms;

(b)

a “priority” is an expression of the relative importance of such objectives;
and

(c)

a “target” is a measurable criterion of the public value delivered by the World
Service (based, in particular, on the reach, quality, impact and value for money
that it achieves), which must be consistent with the objectives and priorities
set for the Service.

Without limiting the ability of the BBC and the Foreign Secretary to agree other
objectives under paragraph (5), the objectives for the World Service must include–
(a)

providing an accurate, impartial and independent news service covering
international and national developments; and

(b)

reflecting the UK – its people, cultures and national life.

In addition to the specific provisions of paragraphs (4) to (7), the relationship
between the Foreign Secretary and the BBC for the provision of the World Service
is based on the following principles—
(a)

the BBC has full editorial and managerial independence and integrity in the
provision of the World Service, within the structure of the Charter and this
and any other Framework Agreement;

(b)

in particular, the BBC will decide the most effective and efficient way of
delivering the World Service; and

(c)

subject to compliance with the Charter and this and any other Framework
Agreement (including, in particular, clause 68, and the Trust’s policies on fair
trading and competitive impact) the BBC may use the World Service brand to
generate additional income.

The BBC should ensure that it always has such information regarding international
developments and conditions in countries outside the UK as it considers it needs to
help it plan and prepare the provision of the World Service.

(10) The World Service must maintain high standards of editorial integrity and programme
content and quality, including observing any particular content standards applicable
to the UK Public Services, to the extent that the Trust considers those standards
relevant to the circumstances of the World Service.
(11) Clause 64C makes provision about how the BBC may, by mutual agreement, accept
UK Government funding for defined projects connected with the World Service.
64A. The World Service Operating Licence and service changes
(1)

The Trust must issue an Operating Licence for the World Service under this
clause.

3

(2)

Subject to paragraphs (3) to (5), it is for the Trust to decide the form and contents
of the Operating Licence, including the activities it covers and how it is structured
to accommodate the various language and country services of the World Service.

(3)

The Operating Licence will (amongst other things) define the characteristics of the
World Service, including its remit and scope, and will also record—
(a)

the objectives, priorities and targets for the World Service, and

(b)

the languages in which the World Service is to be provided,

agreed with the Foreign Secretary under clause 64.
(4)

The Operating Licence will also—
(a)

specify the budget for the World Service;

(b)

set out how the World Service will contribute to the promotion of the Public
Purposes and achieve its objectives, priorities and targets; and

(c)

contain such other matters relating to the World Service as the Trust considers
appropriate.

(5)

The Operating Licence shall make provision about making World Service output
available within the UK.

(6)

The BBC may not—
(a)

start a service in a language not currently served, or

(b)

cease entirely to provide services in a particular language,

without the approval of both the Trust and the Foreign Secretary.
(7)

Before a decision is taken to—
(a)

start a service in a language not currently served,

(b)

cease entirely to provide services in a particular language, or

(c)

make any other significant change (as defined in the Operating Licence) to the
World Service or any part of it,

the approval of the Trust must be obtained; and before giving its approval the Trust
must take such steps as it considers appropriate to assess whether the proposed
change is justified in terms of public value.
64B. Performance reporting and reviews of the World Service

4

(1)

The BBC must report in reasonable detail on the performance of the World
Service, both in its annual report (see article 45 of the Charter) and elsewhere as
appropriate.

(2)

The Chairman of the BBC and the Foreign Secretary (or their nominated
representatives) will meet annually to review the performance of the World Service
against the objectives, priorities and targets agreed under clause 64(5) (including
giving consideration to a written report from the Trust on the performance of the
Service against those objectives, priorities and targets).

(3)

The Trust must review the World Service as a whole at least once every five years
and such a review should, in particular, consider the performance of the World
Service in delivering what is set out in the Operating Licence.

(4)

The Trust may at its discretion also conduct more frequent reviews of particular
aspects of the World Service.

(5)

In conducting reviews the Trust should take appropriate account of the views of
licence fee payers and of people across the world who make up the actual or intended
audience of the World Service.

(6)

If, at the end of a review, the Trust reaches the conclusion that it has concerns which
may need to be addressed through an amendment of the Operating Licence, the
Trust must convey those concerns to the Executive Board.

(7)

The resolution of those concerns to the satisfaction of the Trust should occur in
accordance with any applicable Protocols.

64C. World Service: agreed supplementary funding
(1)

The BBC may enter into an agreement under which the UK Government provides
funding to enable the BBC to undertake particular defined projects connected with
the World Service.

(2)

Any such project must be approved in advance by the Trust and must be—

(3)

5.

(a)

consistent with clause 64 (and especially clause 64(8)(a) and (10)) and the
World Service Operating Licence; and

(b)

undertaken for a specific period or a specific purpose.

An agreement under paragraph (1) must provide for the UK Government to meet in
full the BBC’s costs relating to the project in question (which, accordingly, may not
be funded out of sums paid to the BBC under clauses 75(1) and 78).”

BBC Monitoring

As from 1st April 2013, delete clause 88 (monitoring services) and insert the following new
clause before clause 65 (and above the heading “FAIR TRADING AND COMPETITIVE
IMPACT” that precedes that clause)—
“64D. BBC Monitoring
(1)

BBC Monitoring consists of the monitoring (and where applicable, recording)
of media output that is openly available from around the world and includes the
provision of related services such as the preparation and distribution, usually in
electronic form, of products such as reports and digests of international news,
comment and other information.

(2)

BBC Monitoring is provided in the public interest and for the benefit of users,
including—
(a)

contributing to the provision of news in the BBC’s services, and

(b)

providing monitoring services to the UK Government and other public
authorities.

5

(3)

BBC Monitoring shall be provided in accordance with a scheme agreed between the
BBC and the relevant stakeholders, but the BBC has full editorial and managerial
independence and integrity in the provision of BBC Monitoring, within the structure
of the Charter and this and any other Framework Agreement.

(4)

Such a scheme shall govern the specification, management, operation and funding
of the services to be provided; and the first scheme made under this clause must be
agreed so as to take effect on 1st April 2013.

(5)

Without limiting the scope of what other matters may be included in it, the scheme
must specify the monitoring services to be provided out of the budget set and funded
by the BBC under this clause (“the core services”); must provide that—

(6)

(a)

the Trust, when setting the overall strategic direction of the BBC, is responsible
for defining the position of BBC Monitoring within that strategy;

(b)

the Trust is responsible for approving the high-level strategy for BBC
Monitoring and the budget for the core services; and

(c)

no sums paid to the BBC under clauses 75(1) and 78 may be used in the
provision of any additional services, except in the case of any that are requested
by, and provided to, users within the BBC;

and must also make provision for agreeing changes to the core services and for the
resolution of disputes between relevant stakeholders and between one or more such
stakeholders and the BBC.

Any reference in this clause to “additional services” is a reference to monitoring
services which the BBC agrees (whether in or under the scheme or otherwise) to
provide in addition to the core services; and accordingly, additional services may
be provided only on terms requiring them to be funded in full from a source outside
the budget for core services set pursuant to paragraph (5), such as by one or more
relevant stakeholders or any other person (whether or not a public authority) using
them or requesting their provision.

(7)

In providing BBC Monitoring, the BBC must maintain high standards of editorial
integrity and quality, including observing any particular content standards applicable
to the UK Public Services, to the extent that the Trust considers those standards
relevant to the circumstances of BBC Monitoring.

(8)

In providing monitoring services, other than such additional services (if any) as
are provided solely for the use of the BBC or other users which are not public
authorities, the BBC is to be regarded as an agent of the Crown, and to be acting in
the public interest.

(9)

In this clause—
(a)

“monitoring services” means the activities of monitoring and recording media
output and the provision of related services, as mentioned in paragraph (1);

(b)

“relevant stakeholders” means the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the
Ministry of Defence, the Cabinet Office and the security and intelligence
Agencies; and

(c)

references to “media output” include—
(i)

6

any sound, text, data, still or moving pictures or other content carried
or accessed by means of an electronic communications network or

an electronic communications service (within the meaning of the
Communications Act 2003),
(ii)

text or pictures in any print medium, and

(iii) the output of any news agency.
(10) What the BBC does for the purposes of this clause is not to be regarded as—
(a)

requiring a service licence;

(b)

involving the provision of a service for any of the purposes of this Agreement;
or

(c)

falling within the scope of clause 22.”

WELSH LANGUAGE SERVICES
6.

S4C Partnership

The following heading and new clause is inserted after clause 63—
“WELSH LANGUAGE SERVICES

63A Partnership and funding model for S4C Services
(1)

From 1st April 2013 the provision of the S4C Services shall be organised and funded
as a partnership between the BBC and S4C under arrangements that accord with
the principles relating to the future of those Services contained in the Secretary of
State’s letter to the Chairman of the BBC dated 21st October 2010 (“the settlement
letter”).

(2)

Those arrangements must provide for the funding of the S4C Services according to
the following framework—

(3)

(a)

in the financial year 2013/14, the BBC will provide direct financial support
of £76.3 million, and the Government will provide direct financial support of
£6.7 million;

(b)

in the financial year 2014/15, the BBC will provide direct financial support
of £76 million and the Government will provide direct financial support of £7
million;

(c)

before the end of financial year 2014/15, a review of the strategy and finances
of the S4C Services will be completed, and its outcome will inform future
services;

(d)

in financial years 2015/16 and 2016/17 funding will be for the BBC to
determine, but will—
(i)

reflect continuing synergies and efficiencies; and

(ii)

be consistent with the commitment to a strong and independent Welsh
language television service set out in the settlement letter.

The arrangements must also contain—
(a)

governance arrangements agreed between the BBC and the Secretary of State
in a Framework Agreement to amend further this Agreement; and
7

(b)

operational arrangements agreed (subsequent to the governance arrangements)
between the BBC and S4C.

(4)

Governance arrangements must not be made until discussions between the BBC,
the Secretary of State and S4C have been concluded.

(5)

In this clause, “the S4C Services” means—

(6)

(a)

the television channel known as S4C (but referred to in the Communications
Act 2003 as “S4C Digital”), and

(b)

any television channel or other service approved under section 205 of the
Communications Act 2003 that is provided by S4C as a public service on or
after 1st April 2013.

This clause shall cease to have effect if, by 31st July 2012 or such other date as the
Trust and the Secretary of State may agree in writing, the arrangements mentioned
in paragraph (1) have not been made; and in that event—
(a)

the Secretary of State will not reduce the amounts paid to the BBC under
clauses 75(1) and 78 for the provision of the S4C Services, but

(b)

the Trust will propose a one-off reduction in the level of the fee payable
for a television licence such that the reduction in total revenue from such
fees equates to the contribution the BBC would otherwise have made to the
funding of S4C.”

LOCAL TELEVISION SERVICES
7.

Local television

The following heading and new clause is inserted after clause 95—
“LOCAL TELEVISION
95A. Local television
(1)

With a view to the BBC supporting the provision of local television services by local
media companies from 1st April 2013 (or such other date as the Secretary of State
and the BBC may agree) to the end of the period of the Charter, the Secretary of State
and the BBC must comply with arrangements (“local television arrangements”)
agreed between the BBC and the Secretary of State in accordance with this clause.

(2)

Local television arrangements may provide for support to be given by the provision
of direct financial support, or (if appropriate and by agreement) by support in
kind, or by a combination of such methods; but the BBC must not enter into such
arrangements unless the Trust is satisfied (in particular) that they make appropriate
provision to—
(a)

8

give the Trust an appropriate role in overseeing the use of any support
provided by the BBC under the arrangements, in particular as regards seeking
to ensure—
(i)

that local television services supported under the arrangements meet the
needs of members of the public in the localities they serve,

(ii)

that value for money overall is secured, and

(iii) that the support is provided and used consistently with the BBC’s other
obligations, including in a manner that promotes the BBC’s Public
Purposes;
(b)

(c)
(3)

(4)

(5)

ensure that the cost to the BBC of the assistance to local media companies
shall not exceed—
(i)

£25 million in capital costs, to be provided during the financial year
2013/14 (subject to sub-paragraph (c)) to support local television
services, and

(ii)

£5 million per annum for the acquisition from local media companies
of content which has been included in those companies’ local television
services, with a view to using it in BBC services, starting in the financial
year 2014/15 and ending in 2016/17; and

permit any underspend of switchover funds to be used to fund any capital
expenditure in support of local television services required prior to the
financial support specified in sub-paragraph (b)(i).

Local television arrangements shall also set out a framework for the BBC’s support
for local television services, and in particular—
(a)

must not require the BBC to agree support arrangements separately with
individual local media companies;

(b)

must not require the BBC to decide which local media companies to support
in any locality;

(c)

must not require the BBC to acquire content from local media companies
unless the BBC is satisfied that it is suitable for inclusion in a UK Public
Service and that the price represents value for money;

(d)

must not permit any local media company in receipt of BBC support under
this clause which carries out other activities in addition to those which are
required in order to provide local television services to use that support to
benefit (directly or indirectly) those other activities; and

(e)

must provide that BBC support will end at the end of the period of the Charter,
unless further arrangements are agreed between the BBC and the Secretary of
State for such support to continue.

In this clause—
(a)

“local media company” means a body corporate that provides one or more
local television services;

(b)

“local television service” means a service whose principal purpose is to
provide users with television programmes centred on a locality or localities
below the regional level; and

intended for the performance of the BBC’s obligations under a scheme made
in pursuance of clause 39 or for funding activities carried out by SwitchCo
Limited (which is also known as “Digital UK”).

What the BBC does for the purposes of this clause is not to be regarded as—

9

(a)

requiring a service licence;

(b)

involving the provision of a service for any of the purposes of this Agreement;
or

(c)

falling within the scope of clause 22.”

8. BROADBAND ROLL-OUT AND USE
The following heading and new clause is inserted after clause 41—
“BROADBAND
41A. Broadband roll-out and use
(1)

The Secretary of State and the BBC must comply with terms and conditions agreed
between them in accordance with this clause under which specified sums will be
used to enable and encourage the provision and use of broadband infrastructure and
of services provided by means of such infrastructure.

(2)

In this clause, “specified sums” means sums that are—
(a)

paid to the BBC under clauses 75(1) and 78, and

(b)

specified in terms and conditions agreed between the BBC and the Secretary
of State as sums that may be spent in accordance with the UK Government’s
broadband objectives and in a manner that promotes the BBC’s Public
Purposes.

(3)

The specified sums may not exceed £150 million in each of the financial years from
2013/14 to 2016/17 (but sums unspent in one such year may be retained by the BBC
and carried forward to another).

(4)

The BBC must not enter into terms and conditions for the purposes of this clause
unless the Trust is satisfied (in particular) that they make appropriate provision
to—
(a)

(5)

10

give the Trust an appropriate role in overseeing the use of funds provided by
the BBC under them, in particular as regards—
(i)

securing value for money, and

(ii)

ensuring that the funds are used consistently with the BBC’s other
obligations, including in a manner that promotes the BBC’s Public
Purposes and is consistent with clause 12;

(b)

allow for the Trust to be appropriately represented in any organisation having
responsibilities in connection with determining how the funds are used; and

(c)

permit at least a proportion of such funds to be used by the BBC for measures
aimed at stimulating demand for broadband infrastructure and for services
provided by means of such infrastructure, consistent with the Public
Purposes.

In the event that terms and conditions are not agreed pursuant to this clause by 31st
December 2012 the Secretary of State may instead reduce the sums paid to the
BBC under clauses 75(1) and 78 provided that he has first engaged directly with the

Chairman of the BBC on the matters in dispute and they have attempted to resolve
those matters jointly.
(6)

Any reduction under paragraph (5) is not to exceed, in aggregate, £600 million,
and is to be applied subject to a maximum reduction of £150 million in each of
the financial years set out in paragraph (3) to the sums otherwise to be paid under
clauses 75(1) and 78 in each of those years.

(7)

What the BBC does for the purposes of this clause is not to be regarded as—
(a)

requiring a service licence;

(b)

involving the provision of a service for any of the purposes of this Agreement;
or

falling within the scope of clause 22.”

VALUE FOR MONEY
9. Value for money
(1)

As from 1st January 2012, for clause 79 of the 2006 Agreement substitute—
“79. Value for money examinations
(1)

The Trust must examine the value for money achieved by the BBC in using the
sums paid to it under clauses 75(1) and 78.

(2)

The ways in which the Trust will fulfil that responsibility include—
(a)

adopting annually an audit programme specifying the subject-matter of value
for money reviews it has decided should be conducted by or on behalf of the
Trust, other than those to be conducted by the NAO (“NAO reviews”),

(b)

conducting, or receiving and responding to reports of, such value for money
reviews, and

(c)

receiving and responding to reports of NAO reviews.

(3)

The subject-matter of NAO reviews shall be determined by the Comptroller and
Auditor General (“CAG”); and accordingly, each year, the CAG shall send the Trust
a written list of the value for money reviews the CAG has decided the NAO should
conduct in the following calendar year and indicate in the list when each review is
expected to be conducted (but subject to paragraphs (4) to (7)).

(4)

The CAG shall consult the Trust before deciding the timing of such reviews.

(5)

If, in the course of a calendar year, the CAG considers that there are exceptional
reasons that justify an alteration of the reviews or the timetable set out in the list for
that year sent to the Trust pursuant to paragraph (3), the CAG may, on any one or
more of the relevant dates, send the Trust a revised list accompanied by a statement
of those reasons.

(6)

For the purposes of paragraph (5), “the relevant dates” are 31st March, 30th June
and 30th September (or the first working day to fall after the date in question, as the
case may be).

11

(7)

In the case of an NAO review of any subject-matter that is to be conducted as a
result of an alteration made under paragraph (5)—
(a)

paragraph (4) applies, but

(b)

in particular, an NAO review of any subject-matter cannot be commenced
before the completion of any value for money study or other review of that
subject-matter that is already being conducted by or on behalf of the Trust on
the relevant date on which the revised list mentioned in paragraph (5) is sent
to the Trust by the CAG.

(8)

In adopting its audit programme under paragraph (2)(a), the Trust must take account
of any notification it has received from the CAG under paragraph (3) or (5).

(9)

The CAG has a right of access to all such information as the CAG reasonably
requires for the purpose of—
(a)

enabling the CAG to decide which activities of the BBC may, or will, be
included in the subject-matter of NAO reviews, or

(b)

enabling the NAO to conduct such reviews.

(10) The Trust must enter into suitable arrangements, including with—
(a)

the NAO, and

(b)

other suitable organisations,

to carry out value for money reviews including the NAO reviews.
(11) Such arrangements shall be on terms requiring that, on completion of any such
review, the NAO or other organisation which carried it out shall submit a report on
it exclusively to the Trust.
(12) Arrangements made with the NAO under paragraph (10)(a) must be on terms
which—
(a)

require the factual content of any report to be submitted under paragraph (11)
to be agreed by the BBC before submission, but

(b)

allow the NAO to retain full discretion over the report’s conclusions and
recommendations.

(13) On receiving a report submitted under paragraph (11), the Trust must—
(a)

consider those matters in it that in the Trust’s view ought to be taken into
account in examining value for money for the purposes of paragraph (1);

(b)

decide whether any action should be taken in the light of the report; and
