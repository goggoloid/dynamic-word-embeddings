Government response to the Scottish Affairs Select
Committee Report on the Video Games Industry in
Scotland
Introduction
1.
The Government welcomes the Scottish Affairs Select Committee’s
Second Report of session 2010-12.
2.
We are grateful to the Committee for its examination of the Video
Games Industry in Scotland, the key issues affecting the video games sector
and relevant Government policies, based on written and oral evidence from
stakeholders. We welcome the consideration the Committee has given these
issues.
3.
The Government agrees with the Committee’s assessment that the
video games sector has grown rapidly over a relatively short space of time to
now represent a major global industry. The predicted strong annual growth
rate of the world’s market for video games offers great opportunities for
games businesses in the UK and for our future economy. We agree also that
the UK video games sector is currently facing a number of challenges
including competition for investment from countries such as Canada,
concerns about the ability in coming years to be able to source enough
employees with the specific mix of skills that games development studios
prefer and the need for a prevalence of more sustainable business models.
4.
The video games sector is undergoing an unparalleled period of
change as the proportion of the general population playing games continues
to expand, the move to more online content delivery progresses and new
patterns emerge in terms of the type of games content consumers prefer and
in the way they wish to consume it. Government aims to create the right
conditions to ensure UK-based games businesses are well placed to exploit
the opportunities that are emerging to develop new, more successful business
models and to develop compelling propositions for original intellectual
property. Many games companies for example will benefit from measures
introduced in the June 2010 Budget and in Budget 2011, including reductions
in corporation tax and changes to the Research and Development (R&D) tax
credit scheme which will offer an increased financial incentive to many
innovative games development studios.
5.
The UK video games sector remains the largest in Europe employing
around 9,000 people in games development in 2010 in companies located
across the UK. We note that recent data from analysts Games Investor
Consulting for trade body Tiga suggests there has been a welcome growth in
new video games company formation in the UK since 2008, with some 145
new entrants mainly focussed on the newer markets such as mobile and
social games.
3

6.
Government has carefully considered all the recommendations made
by the Committee in its Report and this document represents its response.

Conclusions and recommendations
More needs to be done to future proof age verification for video games
accessed online. The industry and universities are well placed to
research how best to go about ensuring children cannot gain access to
inappropriate adult content. Therefore we recommend that Government
look into supporting such research and ask the industry to see how they
too can invest in such research as a part of their corporate social
responsibility (para 20)
7.
As the Committee acknowledges, significant improvements have been
made by the video games industry in relation to the need to protect children
from content unsuitable for their age-groups. We will continue to work with
industry to encourage their endeavours to provide better information for
parents on video games content and on improved parental controls on
equipment.
8.
Creating a safer online environment for children and young people is
the core aim of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS). UKCCIS
brings together over 170 representatives from Government, hardware and
software manufacturers, children’s charities, parenting groups, internet
service providers, social networks and regulatory bodies.
9.
The work of UKCCIS is overseen by an Executive Board which is
chaired jointly by Ministers from the Department for Education (DfE) and the
Home Office. The Board sets the strategic direction for UKCCIS and
determines priority areas of work for members of the Council to take forward
by project groups. The decisions made by the Board are informed by the
findings of the UKCCIS Evidence Group, a panel of experts led by Professor
Sonia Livingstone who are building an evidence base of research relating to
the safety of children online.
10.
There is currently no “silver bullet” solution to prevent children and
young people being exposed to inappropriate content in online environments
and a multi-faceted approach to this problem is needed. At present, two
UKCCIS project groups are examining how to limit the availability of ageinappropriate content in all online environments, including videogames; the
Parental Controls group and the Age Verification group.
11.
The Parental Controls group is examining the parental control and
filtering software currently available across all internet enabled devices,
looking at the level of uptake of parental controls and working towards
recommendations that could be adopted by industry in order to improve the
availability and uptake of parental controls. The group is looking at the
evidence of how effective currently available parental controls are and
4

seeking solutions to common barriers to their uptake along with problems that
can arise with such software for example, over-blocking.
12.
The Age Verification group is seeking to identify the policy and
legislative barriers to the deployment of a large-scale technical solution to
verifying the age of internet users in the UK. Experts from across Europe and
the USA are working alongside UKCCIS members in this group to share their
experience with online age verification including examples of best practice
and barriers to implementation. This group will report its findings to the
UKCCIS Board and make recommendations about any changes needed to
policy or legislation in the UK to facilitate a more robust method of online age
verification.
We believe that a cost benefit analysis should be done of the video
games industry and the film industry to see which gives the better value
for money (para 50)
13.
Government welcomes the Committee’s analysis of the discussions
and issues around the potential for a tax relief to support the production of
video games in the UK. We note that the Committee is divided over the case
for a tax relief for the sector and is unlikely to come to a consensus on this
issue.
14.
We do not see a case for carrying out a cost benefit analysis of the film
and of the video games industries at present. The film and video games
industries both make valuable contributions to the UK economy. However,
film tax relief was not introduced exclusively to address an economic policy
objective. The scheme is designed with a primarily cultural aim of promoting
the sustainable production of films with British cultural content that may not
otherwise be made. The scheme is approved as a State aid, under Article 107
(3) (d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as an aid to
promote culture.
15.
The case put forward for providing a tax incentive for the development
of video games is to provide a competitive tax environment for the video
games industry. The Government seeks to provide a competitive tax
environment not just for the video games industry, but for companies in all
sectors. Building on the aim to create the most competitive corporate tax
regime in the G20, The Corporate Tax Road Map, published in November
2010, set out how the Government intends to approach reform of the
corporate tax system. It is the Government’s view that, in general, providing a
low corporate tax rate with fewer reliefs and allowances will provide the best
incentive for business investment, promoting economic growth.
16.
The June 2010 Budget announced that a tax incentive for the
development of video games would not be introduced. However, the
Government announced phased reductions in the main rate of corporation tax
which will provide a competitive tax environment for companies in all sectors,
including the video games industry. Following the further reduction announced
in Budget 2011, the UK’s main rate of corporation tax will be 23 per cent by
5

2014. This will be the lowest rate in the G7, and the 5th lowest in the G20,
ensuring that the UK remains an internationally competitive place to do
business.
17.
Additionally, Budget 2011 also announced a series of reforms to the
R&D tax credit schemes and to the schemes designed to incentivise equity
investment in smaller, higher growth companies- the Enterprise Investment
Scheme (EIS) and Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs). These reforms included
increasing the rate of EIS income tax relief to 30% and increasing the rate of
SME R&D relief to 225% by 2012. These changes will help stimulate
investment in, and by, innovative companies in the games sector.
We are surprised and disappointed that the Minister for Culture,
Communications and Creative Industries was only able to lobby the
Treasury indirectly on the games tax relief. We expect the industry to be
better represented in future. We invite the Government to explain how it
will ensure that the voice of the industry is properly represented and
give an undertaking that this experience will not be repeated (para 54)
18.
As the Prime Minister announced on 18th January 2011, sponsorship
of the video games industry is now centralised within the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). DCMS has a clear, focussed remit to
champion the video games industry in Whitehall, seeking to ensure that the
sector’s interests are fully taken into account in the development of
Government policies.
19.
The Government engaged intensively with the video games sector in
the process of developing the Digital and Creative Industries Plan for Growth,
published alongside Budget 2011. Based on evidence gathered through
consultation with industry stakeholders, the Minister for Culture,
Communications and Creative Industries presented his proposals for creating
the best conditions for stimulating private sector growth to a ministerial group
chaired by the Chancellor and the Business Secretary in February 2011.
Subsequently the Plan for Growth set out Governments ambitions for the UK
to be a world leader in the creative industries – including video games – with
specific actions to tackle major barriers to growth and create the right
conditions for businesses to flourish.
20.
Following a roundtable with business leaders from the creative
industries chaired by the Secretaries of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills (BIS) and for DCMS on 8 February 2011, it was agreed that the group
would continue to meet regularly as a new Creative Industries Council. The
Council – which includes senior representation from the video games industry
- will focus on coordinating concerted action to address major barriers to
growth.
We recommend that the possibility of introducing a tax relief be kept
under review, and the health of the industry be monitored for the
potentially malign effects of uneven international competition. We
recommend that the Government, meanwhile, undertake a full and
6

comprehensive assessment to determine the benefits of such a relief, as
well as examining those countries whose industries continue to flourish
without Government support (para 57)
21.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer keeps all decisions on tax policy
under review. Maintaining the competitiveness of the UK’s tax system remains
a priority for the Government. The Plan for Growth, published alongside the
Budget, reaffirmed the ambition to create the most competitive tax system in
the G20.
22.
However, the Government recognises that tax is only one factor when
looking to support growth and investment by businesses in the UK. The Plan
for Growth also outlined the Government’s ambitions to make the UK one of
the best places in Europe to start, finance and grow a business; to encourage
investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy; and to
create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.
23.
Working towards these ambitions will ensure that progress is made
towards achieving the Government’s economic policy objective of strong,
sustainable and balanced growth.
24.
We welcome the Committee’s assessment that measures in Budget
2010 would have a positive impact on start-up companies and SMEs in the
video games sector.
We recommend that the Government set out how it plans to work with
NESTA on adapting the research and development tax credits so that
video games companies can make full use of the scheme (para 63)
25.
On 29 November 2010, the Government published a consultation on
the support that the R&D tax credit schemes provide for innovation. Six
consultation events were held nationally and over 80 responses were
received before the closing date on 22 February 2011.
26.
As an initial response, the Government announced a package of
changes to improve and simplify the schemes in Budget 2011, including
increasing the SME scheme rate of relief to 225 per cent from April 2012,
subject to State aid approval. These changes will benefit innovative
companies across the economy. We note that these announcements were
welcomed by representatives of the video games industry.
27.

The Government will publish a full consultation response in May 2011.

The creation and retention of intellectual property is a priority issue for
the UK video games industry. We welcome the review of the taxation of
IP currently being undertaken by Government. We expect Government
to set out for the implementation of the recommendations of the taxation
of IP review (para 66)

7

28.
The taxation of innovation and intellectual property, published on 29
November 2010, announced that the Government would introduce a reduced
10 per cent rate of corporation tax for profits arising from patents, effective
from 1 April 2013, and that it would consult on the support R&D tax credits
provide for innovation.
29.
Budget 2011 announced a package of changes to improve and simplify
the R&D tax credit schemes, and that further consultations on both the Patent
Box and R&D tax credits will be published in May 2011.
The Government has a responsibility to help create an economic
environment in which the creative industries can flourish. Impediments
for growth in the UK are emerging and we believe the Government
should make the future of this industry a priority (para 30).
We recommend that proposals for more targeted support should be set
out by the Government accompanied by a clear and costed action plan
(para 68)
30.
The Digital and Creative Industries Plan for Growth sets out our
intended actions for supporting the future growth of these industries, including
the video games sector.
We support the Government’s decision to commission an independent
review of education and training in the UK video games sector. We
expect the Government to set out a timetable for analysis of the review
and for developing its action plan for working with the Scottish
Government on the recommendations (para 76)
31.
Government agrees that the availability of appropriately skilled
employees is a crucial issue for the UK video games industry, particularly if
we are to pursue our aims of ensuring our games businesses are well-placed
to exploit the fast-growing global market for interactive content. Unfortunately,
as our Plan for Growth acknowledges, there is a shortage of skills across the
wider digital and creative industries, particularly amongst graduates.
32.
In February 2011, the Government welcomed the publication of the
independent Livingstone-Hope Report (“Next Gen”) on skills for the video
games and visual effects sectors. We are grateful to the huge commitment
shown to this valuable work by its leaders Ian Livingstone of Eidos and Alex
Hope of Double Negative and to the efforts of NESTA, Skillset and e-skills UK
towards delivering a comprehensive piece of research and analysis. The
strong response from industry and the education sector to this review was
unprecedented and underlines the priority that stakeholders attach to skills
development.
33.
The Government is in ongoing discussion with a range of stakeholders
about the analysis and recommendations of the Livingstone-Hope Report. Its
evidence is, for example, a useful contribution towards the National
Curriculum Review which is currently underway. As the Government’s Plan
for Growth confirms, Government will respond formally to the Livingstone8

Hope Report in the summer. In the meantime, DCMS is working with the
video games industry on the creation of a Steering Group to follow up the
Livingstone-Hope Report. The Group will meet regularly, where possible
under the chairmanship of the Minister for Culture, Communications and
Creative Industries. Discussions will include consideration of how to work with
the Scottish Government on skills for the video games industry going forward.
There needs to be more focus on hard skills needed for the industry
such as mathematics and computer science. Other important factors
necessary to ensure graduates are both trained for industry and able to
find a job are the levels of engagement between higher education
institutions and industry, and the incentives for industry to take on
talented graduates as trainees. We recommend that the Government’s
strategy for addressing such issues is set out in its response (para 73)
34.
These are all issues that are raised in the context of the LivingstoneHope Report which as noted previously the Government is currently
considering very carefully and will respond to formally in the summer. With
regards to incentives for employers, it is worth noting at this stage that there
is likely to be limited Government support due to the unprecedented financial
difficulties in the public sector.
35.
Government would encourage the video games industry to engage with
the Higher Education (HE) sector to ensure that their skill needs are
effectively expressed. It’s important that the HE sector takes on board these
issues to ensure that the graduates who emerge have the skills employers
need. We welcome the commitment shown by many in the video games
industry to take forward recommendations of the Livingstone-Hope Report
that are identified as primarily for the industry. We are delighted for example
to see the Video Games Ambassadors scheme announced by UKIE and
STEMNET on 24th March 2011, enabling games sector professionals directly
to encourage young people to study subjects such as mathematics and
computer science and thus help improve the future supply of STEM
graduates.
The £5m prototype scheme, to be run by Abertay University, is an
excellent example of support targeted towards a priority issue for the
video games industry. We expect Government to monitor the progress
of scheme, and if it is successful, to explain how it will ensure it is
replicated nationwide (para 74)
36.
Government welcomes the Committee’s positive views on the potential
value of the work being carried out at Abertay University. The University’s
video games prototyping programme is being supported with a £2.5m grant
from UK Government. Naturally grant conditions require us to monitor the
roll-out of the project carefully to ensure it delivers good value for money and
this includes an assessment of the economic impact it has on the UK’s games
sector. It is important to recognise that the prototyping fund being delivered
by the University of Abertay is already nationwide as applications are invited
from eligible games companies based anywhere in the UK.
9

37.
Whilst it is relatively early days with Abertay’s games prototyping
programme and far too soon to make an assessment of its effectiveness, we
are very pleased with progress to date. Some 57 applications were submitted
to the first call for proposals. The 6 projects selected for the first round of
funding are now starting to get underway and are spread all around the UK,
including in Dundee, Liverpool, Bristol and Newcastle. We look forward to an
equally strong response to the current and subsequent calls for proposals.
This Government-supported programme is due to run on until 2013.
The innovative practices in place at the University of Abertay, such as
workplace simulation, the level support given to graduates starting their
own business and the level of cooperation with local industry should be
replicated across the UK. We recommend that the Government set out
how it will develop ways of encouraging the adoption of these practices
nationwide (para 72)
38.
We are already starting to promote the University of Abertay’s
approach to workplace simulation through the Government-funded prototype
programme. Projects around the UK that are funded under the scheme will
include the opportunity for talented students to work directly on the
development of games prototypes.
39.
There are several models of close industry and HE collaboration - the
Livingstone-Hope Report rightly highlights Abertay and also the work of
Bournemouth University in this area, for example – and we would expect to
be looking closely with industry and universities at these as part of the follow
up activity to Livingstone-Hope.
We recommend that Government should outline how it will work with
universities and the industry to ensure talented graduates remain in the
UK (para 78)
40.
The Livingstone-Hope Report sets out a number of actions to promote
industry collaboration and career opportunities in the video games sector.
The video games sector is already looking at a number of possible new
activities aimed at attracting talented graduates.
41.
More generally, as set out elsewhere in this response we are working
towards creating the right conditions in the UK that will encourage the growth
of the video games sector and thus the creation of high-value, rewarding jobs
in games development.
The Government has an important role to play in providing support to
business in attracting finance. We invite Government to outline how
business support is being tailored to video games companies (para 81)
42.
Business support to video games companies in Scotland is of course
the responsibility of the Scottish Government.
10

43.
Government is improving and modernising how it provides information
to businesses and how it supports and encourages those who want to start or
grow their business. Our new approach will include:− Online business information and tools tailored to each business’ needs,
through improvements to the www.businesslink.gov.uk website;
− A national contact centre to help businesses who cannot find the
information they need on the web or who are not connected to the internet;
− Help for start-ups through a tailored package of measures, including an
expansion in the planned New Enterprise Allowance, to help the
unemployed become self employed;
− A network of at least 40,000 experienced business mentors offering
practical advice to existing businesses and people who want to start a
business;
− Business Coaching for Growth, backing high growth SMEs to enable them
to realise their potential;
− Action to raise low entrepreneurial activity among key parts of our
communities, including women, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups
and ex-service personnel.
44.
We will be working alongside the private sector and business support
organisations to help small businesses – including those in the video games
sector - make sense of the range and type of support available to them.
45.
We recognise that there are many excellent private providers of
business advice, in addition to business networks, both online and offline. Our
role is not to duplicate this activity, but to intervene only where markets do not
operate effectively.
We see the need for a more targeted marketing strategy to attract
investment to Scotland and recommend that Government work with the
Scottish Executive and trade associations on a more targeted strategy
to formulate and implement such a strategy relating to the video games
industry in particular. We invite it to set out how it intends to do this
(para 85)
46.
Government welcomes the opportunity to engage with Scottish
Executive on marketing propositions and sales messages for the video games
sector in the UK. UK Trade and Investment’s Marketing Group and Business
Group will be best placed to support this activity.
47.
We are delighted to note the recent announcements by Scottish
Enterprise of two major new video games inward investments in Scotland – in
Dundee (Outplay Entertainment) and Edinburgh (Reloaded Productions).
This is a “golden age of opportunity” for the video games industry, with
small businesses able to access global audiences. It is imperative that
guidance and support is available for these companies. We recommend
that the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries
holds regular meetings with companies in the games industry to
11

develop and provide this support. We recommend that Government
sets out its strategy for engagement with the video games industry and
its underlying criteria to enable the video games industry to secure
Government support (para 87)
48.
The Minister for Culture, Communications and the Creative Industries
engages separately with a wide range of individuals, companies and trade
organisations in the video games sector. He also has a programme of
regular, roundtables with CEOs and other key representatives from across the
sector both on general competitiveness issues and specific policy areas. This
includes for example, planned regular meetings with industry and others
around issues raised in the Livingstone-Hope Report and a major event
planned for May 2011 with NESTA which will bring together video games
companies and investors.
We see an argument for a trade body representing companies in
Scotland with the UK Government, trade associations and games
companies all involved in its creation. We recommend that Government
should set out its action plan for such a body (para 88)
49.
We do not believe that Government should intervene to create new
trade associations for the video games industry. It is entirely for businesses in
the sector to determine how best their interests should be represented
through membership-based organisations.
