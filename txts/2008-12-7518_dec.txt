Autumn Performance Report 2008

Section 1: Introduction
1.1 Public Service Agreements
Public Service Agreements (PSAs) set out the Government’s aims, objectives and key outcome-based targets. They
are agreed with HM Treasury and form an integral part of the spending plans outlined in any Spending Review (SR).
Since their introduction in the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), PSAs have played a vital role in
galvanising public service delivery and driving major improvements in outcomes. Building on this success, over the
past two years the Government has been working with frontline professionals, the public and external experts to
renew the performance management framework for the next decade.
The culmination of this work was the announcement in the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 (CSR2007) in
October 2007 of 30 new PSAs. These set out the Government’s highest priority outcomes for the CSR2007 period,
2008–09 to 2010–11.
This Autumn Performance Report (APR) provides information for the period up to October 2008 on progress by
the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) towards its PSA performance targets in CSR2007. It will also
report on any outstanding PSA performance targets from SR2002 and SR2004. It sets out:

Q

DCMS’s PSA targets and the latest outturn data as at October 2008;

Q

The performance indicators used to measure progress; and

Q

An up-to-date report on performance against the target.

1.2 Departmental Strategic Objectives
As part of the CSR2007, additional performance measures were introduced in the form of Departmental Strategic
Objectives (DSOs). These list the Department’s priorities over 2008–2011 and are designed to complement the
PSAs1. They are comprehensive and represent the fundamental purpose and future direction of the Department.
This APR will be the ﬁrst time DSOs are reported on. It sets out:

Q

DCMS’s DSO targets and latest outturn data at October 2008;

Q

The performance indicators used to measure progress; and

Q

An up-to-date report on performance against the target.

1.3 Value for Money Programme
Building on the achievements of the SR2004 efﬁciency programme, the Government has developed a more
ambitious and far-reaching value for money programme for the CSR2007 period – releasing the resources needed to
sustain the pace of public service improvement and meet the global challenges of the decade ahead. As part of this
programme the Department will build on its success in delivering efﬁciencies by meeting its agreed CSR2007 Value
for Money (VfM) target of £148m by 2010–11.
This APR will be the ﬁrst time the VfM Programme 2008–11 is reported on. It sets out:

Q

DCMS’s VfM target;

Q

The savings achieved to date; and

Q

An up-to-date report on performance against the target.

1.4 Efﬁciency Programme
This APR will also provide the ﬁnal data for the previous efﬁciency programme announced by the Chancellor in the
2003 budget. It sets out:

Q

DCMS’s Efﬁciency target; and

Q

Final efﬁciency gains achieved.

DSOs will also underpin PSAs where the Department is responsible for delivering outcomes under the PSA. For example the
key indicators in PSA 22 for which the Department has the lead responsibility for are directly reﬂected in DSO4.

Autumn Performance Report 2008

Section 2: Executive Summary
This Autumn Performance Report (APR) details the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s (DCMS) progress
on delivery against its Public Service Agreements (PSAs), Departmental Strategic Objectives (DSOs) and the Value
for Money (VfM) programme arising from the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007. It will also report against
any outstanding targets from Spending Reviews 2004, and 2002. It also includes a section on outstanding Public
Accounts Committee (PAC) recommendations.
DCMS reports on performance twice a year, through the APR and the Departmental Report (which is published in the
spring). The APR provides a brief update on PSAs, DSOs and the VfM programme targets. More detailed reporting on
this and other areas of Departmental business will be published in the DCMS Departmental Report 2009.

CSR2007
PSA22: (Olympic and Paralympic Games with a sustainable legacy)
Strong progress has been achieved against the basket of indicators that underpin PSA22. Predominately preparation
of the Olympic Park for Games time and legacy; and construction of the main venues. However, the current economic
climate has led to uncertainty in ﬁnancing arrangements, which is putting pressure on costs in those areas.
Performance in terms of the sustainability indicators (e.g. reducing waste and carbon emissions) is on track. There
is also progress on the development of structures to help maximise the 2012 regeneration beneﬁts and against the
success measures set out in the PSA.
The new Physical Education and Sport Strategy for Young People (PESSYP) faces different challenges, in particular
the need to target young people (particularly hard-to-reach segments) to persuade them to take up the sporting
offer and to stay involved in sport over the longer term. Evidence for the previous CSR period (2005–2008) shows
further strong performance with improvement in the proportion of children aged 5–16 who undertake high quality
PE and out of hours school sport increasing from 69% in 2004–05 to 90% in 2007–08.

Value for Money 2008-11
The Department, while seeking to achieve its PSA targets, is operating within a period where it has to achieve
signiﬁcant efﬁciency savings.
DCMS, working with its Non-Departmental Public Bodies, has achieved £32.7m cash-releasing savings as at October
2008. The target for 2008–09 is £48m; therefore DCMS is ahead of target. There is a real opportunity to build on and
deliver further savings over the next two quarters.

Departmental Strategic Objectives
Following the CSR2007, additional performance targets were agreed in the form of Departmental Strategic Objectives
(DSOs). DCMS has four DSOs, one of which directly reﬂects the PSA22.

DSO1: Opportunity
DCMS aims to widen opportunities for all to participate in culture and sporting activities. This DSO has not yet been
assessed.

DSO2: Excellence
DCMS will create the conditions for excellence to ﬂourish among top artists and sports stars, championing the
provision of top class facilities and services. This DSO has not yet been assessed.

4

Autumn Performance Report 2008

DSO3: Economic Impact
DCMS will aim to maximise the economic impact of its investment, improving value for money, and protect
consumers through proportionate and effective regulation. There has been strong progress in this DSO’s two key
indicators:

Q

Administrative burdens on business caused by DCMS regulation are on course to reduce by £5.2m by April
2009; and

Q

There has been an increase in the proportion of households that have converted to digital television (+0.8%
during quarter 2 in 2008).

DSO4: Olympics
DCMS will deliver a successful and inspirational Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012 that provide for a sustainable
legacy and get more children and young people taking part in high quality PE and sport.
This DSO directly reﬂects PSA22 (see above). There has been an improvement in three out of ﬁve indicators.

SR2004
PSA1: (PE and School Sport)
The target to increase the percentage of school children who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high
quality PE and school sport to 85% has been met and exceeded (90% in 2007–08).
PSA2: (Halt the year-on-year increase in obesity among children)
This has not yet been assessed. It is estimated that meaningful data will be available in early 2009.
PSA3: (Increase take-up of culture and sporting opportunities from priority groups)
There is some slippage against this target, made up of sport, arts, museums and historic environment opportunities.
A ﬁnal assessment will be made when further data is released in late December 2008.
PSA4: (Improve productivity of tourism, creative and leisure industries)
There is some slippage against this target (see below SR2002 PSA3).

Efﬁciency Review 2005–08
Against a target of £262m (50% cashable), DCMS achieved savings of £301.1m (71% cashable). All ﬁgures are
classiﬁed as ﬁnal and internal audits in 2007 and 2008 determined that DCMS had good systems in place.
Lyons Relocation Target
As a result of the Lyons Relocation target, 771 posts have been relocated outside of London and the South East as
at October 2008. This is against a target of 600 by 2010.

SR2002
PSA3: (Improve productivity of tourism, creative and leisure industries)
This target has not been met. There has been a slight downturn in the productivity trend for the creative industries.
For the leisure industries, there has been some reasonable productivity growth; however, this is counteracted by
decreases in the productivity of travel agencies/tour operators caused by big reductions in employment.

Public Accounts Committee
This APR will also report on activity following Public Accounts Committee (PAC) recommendations. It will provide an
update against any outstanding recommendations (those made up to mid 2008).
Within this APR in Section 8 are updates on the following reports:

Q

Session 2007–08 Forty Second Report – Preparing for Sporting Success at the London 2012 Olympic and
Paralympic Games and Beyond; and

Q

Session 2007–08 Fiftieth Report – Preparations for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

In the future, PAC recommendations will be updated in the Department’s Annual Report.

Autumn Performance Report 2008

Section 3: PSA Targets CSR2007
3.1 PSA22
Deliver a successful Olympic Games and Paralympic Games with a sustainable legacy and get more children
and young people taking part in high quality PE and sport.
PSA22 sets out the Government’s key objectives and outcomes for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and for
PE and sport for children and young people. The aspiration, to deliver a successful Olympic Games and Paralympic
Games with a sustainable legacy and get more children and young people taking part in high quality PE and sport,
is assessed by the following ﬁve indicators:
1.

Construction of the Olympic Park and other Olympic venues to time and budget;

2.

Maximising the regeneration beneﬁts of the 2012 Games;

3.

The Olympic Park and venues are designed and built according to sustainable principles;

4.

Increasing public participation in cultural, community and sporting activities, both across the UK and
internationally; and

5.

The creation of a world-class system for PE and Sport.

These indicators are completely new (with the exception of ‘the creation of a world-class system for PE and Sport’)
and progress is therefore measured against the baseline at the start of the PSA period (April 2008). ‘The creation of
a world-class system for PE and Sport’ partly follows on from the previous DCMS/DCSF School Sports Programme
and is partly a new indicator. Future performance will be measured against progress towards raising the level of
participation against the sporting offer for 5–16 year olds and 16–19 year olds.
DCMS reports on progress against PSA22, which is also one of the DCMS Departmental Strategic Objectives (DSO4).
The Government Olympic Executive (GOE) has responsibility for overseeing the entire Olympic programme and
providing support for the Minister for the Olympics, ensuring that the various delivery partners responsible for
aspects of the overall programme are on track to deliver to challenging standards of quality, as well as to time and
budget. The Olympic programme covers four key areas:

Q

Construction of the Olympic Park and venues and related infrastructure;

Q

Staging – to ensure a successful and safe Games in 2012;

Q

Delivery of Olympic legacy programmes; and

Q

Preparation for the transformation of the Olympic Park for use post-Games.

The GOE works closely with the other bodies tasked to deliver London 2012: the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA),
the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), the Home Ofﬁce, the
Greater London Authority (GLA) and the British Olympic Association (BOA).
The GOE leads on the overall delivery of PSA22 and will report on progress against the ﬁve indicators on a six
monthly basis to 2011. Much of the delivery of the PSA and Legacy Action Plan indicators will be overseen and coordinated by the GOE UK Wide Legacy team whose role covers the physical and non-physical strands of the Olympic
legacy. Day to day delivery of indicator ﬁve will be the responsibility of DCMS and DCSF, who will work together
jointly, overseen by the PE, School Sports and Young People Board (PESSYP). Progress on this indicator will also be
reported to the PSA12 Board, which is responsible for delivery of the Government’s vision for improving the physical,
mental and emotional health of all children.
The overall programme is managed by the 2012 Programme Board and chaired by the Director General of GOE. This
covers the indicators in PSA22 and those set out in greater detail in the Legacy Action Plan published on 6 June 2008.
In turn, the 2012 Programme Board reports to the Economic Development (Olympic and Paralympic Games) (ED
OPG) cabinet sub-committee, chaired by the Chancellor.
Performance Summary: Strong Progress
Factual Assessment: Improvement in three out of ﬁve indicators
Good progress has been achieved against the basket of indicators that underpin PSA22. Progress has been made on
the preparation of the Olympic Park for Games time and legacy; and construction of the main venues which remain
on schedule. However, the current economic climate has led to uncertainty in ﬁnancing arrangements, which is
putting pressure on costs in those areas and this affects the Red; Amber; Green (RAG) ratings relating to budget.
6

Autumn Performance Report 2008

Performance in terms of sustainability indicators is on track. There is also progress on development of structures to
help maximise the 2012 regeneration beneﬁts and against the success measures set out in the PSA agreement. The
programmes that contribute to increasing participation have started and some initial data is available. More detailed
data will be available to show performance in future reports.
The new PE and Sport Strategy for Young People faces different challenges to the previous strategy, in particular the
need to target young people (particularly hard-to-reach segments) to persuade them to take up the sporting offer
and to stay involved in sport over the longer term. Performance over the previous CSR period (2005–2008) shows
further strong performance with improvement in the proportion of children aged 5–16 who do high quality PE and
out of hours school sport from 69% in 2004–05 to 90% in 2007–08.

PSA22.1 – Construction of the Olympic Park and other Olympic venues to time and budget
Delivery of a world class Olympic Park and associated venues to time and budget is critical to hosting a successful
Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012. The creation of a superb new sporting centre in Stratford will give London
the facilities to host the best ever Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in 2012 and will form the core of a
sustainable physical Olympic legacy. Much of the construction on the main venues will be completed by 2011.
Indicator: Progress is assessed by measuring performance for nine key construction projects against ODA time
milestones and the budget allocations for each project. Performance is shown as Red; Amber/Red; Amber; Amber/
Green; Green. The overall rating is based on the lowest rating for each project.
The baseline is the position as at March 2008.

PSA22.2 – Maximising the regeneration beneﬁts of the 2012 Games
The regeneration of the Olympic site at Stratford will be the catalyst for the wider transformation of the heart of East
London. Currently, this area encompasses some of the most disadvantaged boroughs in the UK. The Government is
committed to using the inspiration of 2012 to improve the physical, economic and social conditions of East London
and to increase opportunities for local people and communities. This PSA will set the foundations for achieving the
long-term objective of regenerating East London.
Indicator: Success as set out in the PSA22 Delivery Agreement means:

Q

Agreeing the Olympic Park management structure by December 2008 and the Legacy Masterplan Framework
(LMF) by 2009;

Q

Ensuring the LMF plan and programme has identiﬁed, and is addressing, the key opportunities which the
London 2012 Games present to East London and that the LMF clearly incorporates measures to put in place
the ingredients necessary to create a successful ‘legacy place’ in the Lower Lea Valley/East London after 2012;
and

Q

Ensure that key infrastructure projects relating to the park which will open up its regeneration potential in
legacy are completed.

Progress on the key infrastructure projects is measured against milestones and shown as a ﬁve-point RAG system
(Red; Amber/Red; Amber; Amber/Green; Green). The overall rating is based on the lowest rating for each project.

PSA22.3 – Sustainability
A commitment made as part of London’s bid was that sustainable principles would be fully incorporated into the
design, build and long-term use of the Olympic Park and venues. Many of these measures will be evident in the Park
by 2011.
Consideration of the broad spectrum of sustainability (including climate change, waste, health, bio-diversity and
inclusion), at every development stage will mean that the Park will set a precedent for future development schemes
across the UK and will showcase the Government’s aspirations to design out carbon, minimise waste and water
use, generate and efﬁciently utilise renewable energy, and improve biodiversity and quality of life across the UK for
future generations.
Indicator: Progress is measured by performance against the ﬁve sustainability themes and rated in accordance with
a four point RAG system (Red; Amber/Red; Amber/Green; Green). Since each theme assesses a very different area of
sustainability, each RAG rating is based on progress towards the overall goal:

Q

Carbon – Progress to achieve a reduction in overall carbon emissions associated with the built environment in
the Olympic Park development by 50% by 2013. Progress will be determined against a baseline of ‘progress as
usual’ assuming 2006 Building Regulations, with no further low or zero-carbon technologies in place;

Q

Waste – Reuse or recycle 90% (by weight) of the materials arising through demolition works on the Olympic
Park site;

Q

Biodiversity – No methodology has been set for the biodiversity indicator – this will be developed as part of
London 2012 Biodiversity Plan by the end of 2008 and signed off early 2009.

Q

Health The RAG rating for this indicator will be based on the ODA target of no fatalities and a rate of one or less
reportable accidents per million hours worked (an Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) of 0.1). The current industry
average is an AFR of 1.2 (12 reportable accidents per million hours worked); and

Q

Inclusion – Measure, report and track the trends in the changing ODA site workforce across the following
dimensions: Black, Asian, minority and ethnic people (BAME), women, disabled people and numbers of local
people in employment.

For all themes – apart from Biodiversity – the baseline is the position as at March 2008. The baseline for the
Biodiversity indicator will be set by the London 2012 Biodiversity Plan.

Data Source: ODA Sustainability Reporting – on a quarterly basis. The Commission for Sustainable London 2012
(CSL) provides independent assurance of the sustainability of the 2012 Games, including the ODA’s Sustainability
Strategy and the mechanisms the ODA have put in place to manage their own sustainability performance.

PSA22.4 – Increasing public participation in cultural, community and sporting activities,
both across the UK and internationally
The Olympic and Paralympic Games will give everyone across the UK the opportunity to take part in a wide variety
of Olympic related events and programmes.
The Government will ensure that citizens across the UK, including hard-to-reach groups, have the chance to take
part in cultural, community and physical activities from 2008 until after the Games are over. We also aim to use
these programmes to inspire a signiﬁcant number of these people to go on to take part in further similar activities.
There are currently four programmes which will contribute to this priority:

Q

UK School Games (DCMS lead) – a national annual competition for elite athletes of school age;

Q

Personal Best (Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills lead) – targeted at unemployed and hard
to reach groups, this programme aims to up-skill participants so that they are equipped to ﬁnd work, take part
in volunteering opportunities, or go on to further training;

Q

International Inspiration (DCMS lead) – an international programme to facilitate young people’s participation
in sport, especially in developing countries; and

Q

Cultural Olympiad (DCMS lead) – a range of different cultural programmes and events which will run across
the UK between the Beijing handover and London 2012.

Consideration will be given to extending the programmes which are reported on through this PSA.
Indicator: Number of people across the Nations and Regions of the UK and in other countries taking part in
Government supported programmes associated with the 2012 Games. For the UK School Games, the baseline is set
against the performance in the 2007 Games; for all others a zero baseline is used.

PSA22.5 Creation of a world-class system for PE and Sport
Through the Physical Education and Sport Strategy for Young People (PESSYP), the Government aims to improve the
quantity and quality of PE and sport undertaken by young people aged 5–19, through schools, further education
colleges, clubs and other community providers. Through the strategy, children and young people will be offered up
to ﬁve hours of quality PE and sport each week to beneﬁt their health and ﬁtness as well as their self-conﬁdence
and to improve their wider social skills. This indicator relates to England only.
The new PESSYP faces the challenge of persuading young people (particularly in hard-to-reach segments) to take up
the offer and to stay involved long-term. However, performance over the previous CSR period (2005–2008) shows a
rapid increase in the proportion of children aged 5–16 undertaking at least two hours per week high quality PE and
out of hours School Sports from 69% in 2004–05 to 90% in 2007–08.
Indicator: Percentage of 5–16 years old participating in at least two hours per week of high quality PE and sport
at school, and the percentage of 5–19 year olds participating in at least three further hours per week of sporting
activities. Baseline data for the new aspects of this strategy have not yet been set.

Build more cohesive, empowered and active communities
The Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) is responsible for monitoring and reporting on
overall progress, with indicator six led by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
Indicator 6: The percentage of people who participate in culture or sport.
Success against this indicator means an increase in the percentage of people who engage in culture or sport.
Performance
Performance has not yet been assessed. The baseline will be set in summer 2009 when data from the Taking Part
Survey is available.

3.3 Other PSAs
In addition DCMS’s work contributes to the following PSAs led by other Government departments:

Section 4: Value for Money CSR2007
4.1 Value for Money Programme 2008–11
Introduction
DCMS has a strong track record in delivering value for money and intends to build on its achievements during
2008–11 as part of a wider government drive to spend public money ever more effectively.
The Department will build on its success in delivering efﬁciencies by meeting its agreed CSR2007 Value for Money
(VfM) target of £148m by 2010–11. Savings will be delivered largely through Non-Departmental Public Bodies
(NDPBs) as the great majority of DCMS funding is channelled through NDPBs, although DCMS itself will make
annual real-terms reductions of 5% in its administration spending.
The Department has worked closely with its NDPBs to identify suitable savings. All NDPBs with a near-cash
resource grant-in-aid in 2007–08 of more than £3m from the Department is contributing to delivery of the 3% VfM
savings.
Relevant NDPBs hold VfM plans, setting out where and how they expect to make savings for the CSR2007 period.
These plans are ‘live’ documents and are revisited and updated periodically to ensure they remain accurate and
realistic.
Value for Money savings target:

Q

£48m cash-releasing savings in 2008–09;

Q

£97m cash-releasing savings in 2009–10; and

Q

£148m cash-releasing savings in 2010–11.

Performance to date
Achieved: £32.7m as at 31 September 2008
All savings are cash releasing, calculated net of implementation costs and are sustainable.

The DCMS VfM programme is at a very early stage, however, there has already been some signiﬁcant savings
achieved. For example;

Q

Arts Council England has made allocative savings of approximately £17m by reprioritising investment into the
highest performing programmes;

Q

Sport England has realised efﬁciency savings of £1.6m following renegotiation of their Leisure Connection
contract that has reduced the operating costs. They have also made £350k administrative savings through the
rationalisation of outsourced contracts and improved cost controls;

Q

English Heritage has achieved administrative efﬁciency savings of over £1.3m through improving the
management of their estates. They have relocated a proportion of staff outside of London and the South East,
and restructured their facilities management. This has ultimately led to a reduction in rent and rates; and

The Department’s internal savings target of £1m for 2008–09 will be secured through a reduction in administration
expenditure. We are working on a range of measures including savings on non-pay costs such as accommodation, and
through reductions in staff costs. We expect to be in a position to report on these savings in the Department’s Annual
Report 2009.
Capital Savings for 2008–09 will be reported in full in the Department’s Annual Report 2009.

Autumn Performance Report 2008

Q

The British Library has reported over £1.2m worth of savings through improving their management of vacancies
and reducing their use of agency staff. They have also more effectively managed their overtime needs and have
been able to reduce their administration budget accordingly.

Future plans
Following the ﬁrst collection of VfM data, the NDPBs have considered the next two quarters and have further plans
in place to build on existing savings. For example;

Q

The Horniman Museum has undertaken the ground work to enable them to deliver further savings in the
second half of the year. They expect to be able to retender contractors at better rates, realise further savings
through new suppliers and consolidate the changes of a new business model to streamline their operations;

Q

During the next two quarters, the Imperial War Museum will implement their Environmental Strategy for
Sustainable Development, making cash savings particularly through improved energy efﬁciency and reduced
consumption. They also intend to examine procurement across their branches to identify where suppliers can
be streamlined;

Q

The National Gallery also has plans to generate procurement savings through actively reviewing the market
across a range of activities. The Gallery intends to bring its website hosting in-house, thereby generating some
cost and service efﬁciency savings; and

Q

The British Museum has begun a review of its visitor facing operations, which they expect will improve visitor
service. Implementation plans are still in the early stages of development, and although some savings have
already been generated, the next six months will see full implementation and further efﬁciency savings
realised.

Conclusion
The Department is pleased with the progress achieved at this early stage of the VfM programme (68% of 2008-09
target already met). The signiﬁcant savings represent a real opportunity to build on and deliver further savings over
the next two quarters.

Autumn Performance Report 2008

Section 5: Departmental Strategic Objectives (DSOs)
5.1 DSO1: Opportunity
Encourage more widespread enjoyment of culture, media and sport
DCMS will aim to widen opportunities for all to participate in cultural and sporting activities. This will include a focus
on children and young people to ensure that they have the opportunity to participate in high quality cultural and
sporting activities that contribute to their wider outcomes.
Performance Summary: Not yet assessed
Factual Assessment: Not yet assessed
Indicators:
1.

Increasing the proportion of children and young people participating in culture;

2.

Increasing the proportion of children and young people participating in high quality PE and sport; and

3.

Increasing the proportion of adults participating in culture or sport.

Description
DCMS recognises that opportunities to participate in culture, media and sport are not equal across our society. We
want to provide excellent grassroots provision for all groups in society and narrow the gaps that exist in provision
and participation. The aim of the DSO is to provide a greater range of opportunities across our sectors, and narrow
the participation gap between different groups.
Not all outputs/outcomes are measured through standard data collection. There is an emerging body of evidence
that points to our sectors’ impact on a range of outcomes (e.g. educational attainment, physical and emotional wellbeing), impacts that are harder to measure. Therefore, indicators for this DSO focus on participation rates.
Latest Outturn Data
Indicator 1: Data collection started in September 2008. The full baseline results will be available in October 2009.
Indicator 2: This indicator also maps onto indicator ﬁve in PSA22. The baseline, and measure have yet to be
agreed.
Indicator 3: Data collection for this indicator started in April 2008. Trend is based on an indicative baseline from
interpretation of data from the Taking Part survey. Interim baseline data will be available in March 2009, and ﬁnal
baselines set in July 2009.

5.2 DSO2: Excellence
Support talent and excellence in culture, media and sport
DCMS will create the conditions for excellence to ﬂourish among top artists and sports stars. We will champion the
provision of top class facilities and services, inspiring everyone to make the most of their talents and the talents of
others.
Performance Summary: Not yet assessed
Factual Assessment: Not yet assessed
Indicators:
1.

Improving the excellence of the arts organisations, galleries and museums supported by DCMS and our delivery
bodies, building on the recommendations made in the McMaster Review.

Description

14

International culture and sporting successes are among the key components that can inspire national pride and
contribute to our standing in the world. DCMS sectors bring pride and prestige to the country. International success
stems from a combination of factors. DCMS funding is used to create the conditions for excellence to ﬂourish, such
as providing funding for elite athletes to enable them to concentrate on their sport. For cultural bodies, our role
focuses on strategic investment in a national infrastructure that means we are well placed to promote excellence,

Autumn Performance Report 2008

e.g. by making sure that our sponsored bodies are excellently run by world-class individuals. The provision of top
class facilities and services should mean that, in turn, the general population are more inclined to make use of
them.
The creation of a Delivery Plan for DSO2 will be the responsibility of the team identiﬁed to take forward the
implementation of the McMaster Review. This will include developing an appropriate and effective measurement
system for this indicator. Advice on the ﬁnal form of the indicator will be brought to the Department’s Executive
Committee.
Latest outturn Data
DCMS is currently piloting a self-assessment and peer review system for its directly sponsored museums which, if
successful, will form the basis of part of the DSO2 measurement system. Because of the resource intensity of the
peer review process, the baseline measurement across all museums will have to be formed on a rolling basis and only
three museums will have been reviewed by April 2009.
The other part of the DSO2 measurement will take account of the performance of the Arts Council’s Regularly Funded
Organisations. The Arts Council is currently in the stage of public consultation for a system of self-assessment and
peer review and a full system will not be ready until April 2010.

5.3 DSO3: Economic Impact
Realise the economic beneﬁts of the Department’s sectors
DCMS will aim to maximise the economic impact of its investment, improving value for money, taking full advantage
of the contribution these sectors make towards the Government’s long-term goal of raising productivity and
protecting consumers through proportionate and effective regulation.
Performance summary: Strong progress
Factual assessment: Improvement in two out of two indicators
Indicators:
1.

Reducing administrative burdens on business caused by DCMS regulation; and

2.

Increasing the proportion of households that have converted to digital television.

Data Statement
Indicator 1: Reducing administrative burdens
As of April 2008, the DCMS administrative burden baseline was £187.2m with savings anticipated to reduce burdens
by £5.2m in the current year.
In the years from May 2005 to April 2008, DCMS had reduced administrative burdens by 43%, one of the highest
levels of reduction across Whitehall.4

Indicator 2: Digital switchover
Policy background
Starting in 2008 and ending in 2012, television services will go completely digital. To continue to receive TV after
switchover, viewers will need to have converted or upgraded their TV equipment to receive digital signals. The next
area to switch is the Selkirk transmitter group in the Scottish Borders TV region on 6 and 20 November 2008. At
August 2008, 94% of residents of this area knew what they needed to do for switchover, and 99% were comfortable
with the process of switching over. 88% of homes had digital TV on at least one set, and 58% of households were
fully converted. No one has said they do not intend to switch.
4

This is an average ﬁgure based on the range of savings anticipated.

15

Autumn Performance Report 2008

The digital switchover Help Scheme is an integral part of the overall programme and aims to ensure that there is a
safety net for those likely to ﬁnd the switch the most difﬁcult. It provides end-to-end support for vulnerable groups.
The scheme is designed to be “platform neutral” and in Selkirk the standard offer is a Sky satellite service. Other
platforms are also available but may cost more.

5.4 DSO4: Olympics
Olympics and Sport for Young People
DCMS will deliver a successful and inspirational Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012 that provide for a sustainable
legacy and get more children and young people taking part in high quality PE and sport.
Performance Summary: Strong Progress
Factual Assessment: Improvement in three out of ﬁve indicators
Indicators:
1.

Construction of the Olympic Park and other Olympic venues to time and budget;

2.

Maximising the regeneration beneﬁts of the 2012 Games;

3.

The Olympic Park and venues are designed and built according to sustainable principles;

4.

Increasing public participation in cultural, community and sporting activities, both across the UK and
internationally; and

5.

The creation of a world-class system for PE and Sport.

Description
DCMS reports on progress against DSO4, which is also one of the Government’s Public Service Agreements
(PSA22).
The Government Olympic Executive (GOE) leads on the overall delivery and will report on progress against the ﬁve
indicators on a six monthly basis to 2011. Much of the delivery of the indicators will be overseen and co-ordinated
by the GOE UK Wide Legacy team whose role covers the physical and non-physical strands of the Olympic legacy.
Day to day delivery of Indicator 5 will be overseen by DCMS and DCSF, who will work together jointly, overseen by
the PE, School Sports and Young People Board (PESSYP). Progress on this indicator will also be reported to the PSA 12
Board, which is responsible for delivery of the Government’s vision for improving the physical, mental and emotional
health of all children.

17

Autumn Performance Report 2008

The overall programme is managed by the 2012 Programme Board and chaired by the Director General of GOE.
This covers the indicators in PSA22 and those set out in greater detail in the Legacy action Plan published on 6 June
2008. In turn, the 2012 Programme Board reports to the Economic Development (Olympic and Paralympic Games)
(ED OPG) cabinet sub-committee, chaired by the Chancellor.

Section 6: PSA Targets from SR2004
Further details of these PSAs can be found in the 2005–2008 Public Service Agreements Technical Note, available on
our website6. A revised version of this Technical Note was published in November 2007 in accordance with National
Audit Ofﬁce recommendations on PSA4.

6.1 PSA1
Enhance the take-up of sporting opportunities by 5–16 year-olds. This is to enable the percentage of school
children who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality physical education and school sport
within and beyond the curriculum to increase. The goals were from 25% in 2002 to 75% by 2006, to 85% by
2008. The goal for each School Sport Partnership by 2008 is to increase by at least 75%.
Joint target with Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF)
Final performance summary: Met
Indicator
Percentage of 5–16 year-olds in schools who spend a minimum of two hours each week during term time on high
quality PE and sport within and beyond the National Curriculum.
Description
This is a programme of nine linked projects, collectively delivering the PE, School Sport and Club Links Strategy. It is
being delivered through an extensive network of delivery agents and partnerships. The programmes are:

Q

Specialist Sports Colleges

Q

School Sports Partnerships

Q

Gifted and Talented

Q

Qualiﬁcations and Curriculum Authority (QCA) PE and School Sport Investigation

Q

Step into Sport

Q

Professional Development

Q

Club links

Q

Swimming

Q

Sporting Playgrounds

On 1 April 2008 this strategy was replaced by the Physical Education and Sport Strategy for Young People (PESSYP).
This will go on to deliver two hours of high quality PE and sport per week within the school day for all willing 5–16
year-olds. All 5–19 year-olds will also have the opportunity to take part in an additional three hours of sport per
week beyond the school day, delivered by a range of school, community and club providers.

that 90% of 5–16 year-olds now take part in at least two hours of high quality PE and sport in a typical week. This
is above the 85% 2008 national target level. The aim was also to have 400 specialist sports colleges and academies
with a sports focus by the end of 2006. This was also achieved and there are now 470 designated specialist sports
colleges.

Autumn Performance Report 2008

The survey also demonstrates the following successes:

Q

An increase in competitive sport in schools; 41% of pupils taking part in inter-school sport and 66% of pupils
in years 1–11 being involved in intra-school competitive activities;

Q

Greater club participation, with 32% of pupils now participating in club sport. We have also funded the creation
of over 2,000 multi-skill clubs for younger children and a dance links programme;

Q

Increased sport leadership and volunteering, with 12% of pupils in years 1–13 actively involved; and

Q

Greater diversity in the sports available to children and young people, in particular increases in golf, cycling,
archery, ﬁtness and martial arts.

Two data systems are used to measure quantity and quality of provision, as it is not currently cost-effective to
collect data through one system. Up until 2004–05, Ofsted subject reports were used to assess the quality of
provision. Ofsted assessed a sample of about 30 schools in each of the primary, secondary and special sectors. Now
that Ofsted no longer conduct subject-speciﬁc surveys, School Sport Partnerships determine for themselves what
constitutes high quality PE and school sport. This is carried out using a range of publications and guidance developed
on behalf of DCSF by Ofsted, the Qualiﬁcations and Curriculum Authority, the Association for Physical Education
and the Youth Sport Trust.

6.2 PSA2
Halt the year-on-year increase in obesity among children under 11 by 2010, in the context of a broader strategy
to tackle obesity in the population as a hole.
Joint target with Department for Health and Department for Children, Schools and Families.
Performance summary: Not yet assessed
Indicator
Annual performance on tackling obesity is measured by comparing Health Survey for England (HSE) ﬁgures for
national Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile classiﬁcation for children aged between 2 and 10 years (inclusive) for
aggregate three-year periods. Halting the increase would mean no statistically signiﬁcant change in prevalence
between the two three-year periods; 2005/06/07 and 2008/09/10.
Description
This is a comprehensive, cross-Government programme of work to help families lead healthier and more active lives.
As a Department we have made a strong contribution to helping achieve this:

Q

Progress on this target has been supported by the progress made on the school sport target;

Q

The Children’s Plan was published in December 2007, setting out a new commitment for play; and

Q

Ofcom has introduced its new restrictions on broadcast food and drink advertising to children.

The 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review announced a radical reform of the performance management framework
across government. This included a new long-term ambition for obesity in national and local accountability
frameworks in order to reduce the rate of increase in obesity among children under 11, as a ﬁrst step towards a
long-term national ambition by 2020 to reduce the proportion of overweight and obese children to 2000 levels, in
the context of tackling obesity across the population.
The Government Ofﬁce of Science Foresight project, Tackling Obesities: Future Choices provides a clearer
understanding of the complexity and scale of the obesity problem. This means moving away from a focus solely
on obesity to one of promoting healthy weight, healthy lives and recognising that weight is a problem that affects
adults as well as children. A shift in approach means the numbers of overweight and obese people must be reversed
if severe consequences to individual health are to be avoided.

Latest outturn data
The three-year aggregate data for 2002/03/04 showed that the prevalence of obesity among children aged 2–10
was 14.9%. Equivalent aggregate data for 2003/04/05 (published by the National Centre for Social Research) also
indicated a ﬁgure of 14.9%.

20

Autumn Performance Report 2008

While aggregate estimates for the level of obesity for the period 2003/04/05 were the same as for the period
2002/03/04 these results should be treated with caution due to the overlapping periods used in the estimates and
because the estimates are subject to sampling error. The 2004/05/06 results will also include overlapping data and
therefore more meaningful comparisons will not be possible until the 2005/06/07 data is available, which will not
include overlapping data from 2002/03/04. HSE estimates for these data will be available by early 2009.

6.3 PSA3
By 2008, increase the take-up of cultural and sporting opportunities by adults and young people aged 16 and
above from priority groups.
Overall performance summary: Slippage
In agreement with HM Treasury and the National Audit Ofﬁce, the Taking Part survey was only designed to pick up
the percentage changes speciﬁed in the target, so it is hard to give an annual measure of performance. All ﬁndings,
including those of no change, should be treated as indicative and not yet conclusive.
This PSA is measured by the sub-targets described below.
Sports Target
Increasing the number of people from priority groups who participate in active sports at least 12 times a year by 3%
and increasing the number who engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity level sport, at least three times
a week, by 3%7. For this sub-target, priority groups are deﬁned as women, people with a limiting disability, people
from lower socio-economic groups, and people from ethnic minorities.
Description
Approximately one in ﬁve people undertake 30 minutes of moderate intensity sport on three or more different days
per week. Those from our priority groups (deﬁned above) participate signiﬁcantly less than the national average.
There is also considerable regional variation in participation. Through this target we aim to tackle these trends. This
target will be delivered through Sport England, one of our Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs). The range of
interventions comprises:

Q

Marketing sport and promoting its beneﬁts;

Q

Building capacity in the network of development/outreach workers, clubs, coaches and volunteers;

Q

Building infrastructure through innovative facilities projects;

Q

Improving performance measurement at local level, notably through the Active People survey;

Q

Driving up standards of local authority service provision through Comprehensive Performance Assessment/
Local Area Agreements/Local Public Service Agreements (CPA/LAA/LPSA) mechanisms; and

Q

Locally driven partnership projects targeted at hard-to-reach groups.

Performance summary: Slippage

Arts Target
Increasing the number of people from priority groups who participate in arts activity at least twice a year by 2% and
increasing the number who attend arts events at least twice a year by 3%. For this sub-target, priority groups are
deﬁned as people with a disability, people from lower socio-economic groups, and people from ethnic minorities.
Description
Breaking down barriers to access, understanding drivers to engagement and exploiting the full wealth of UK culture
have been key to our strategies in recent years. This target is primarily delivered through Arts Council England (ACE),
one of our NDPBs, but we are also engaging with non-DCMS delivery agents to increase participation across the
sector as a whole. ACE has revised its delivery plan to cover the following six key elements:

Q

Place-focused campaigns in London and the West Midlands, working with Local Authorities and regularlyfunded organisations (RFOs) and also working with local media on a targeted marketing campaign to increase
engagement;

Q

Communications campaign to increase awareness of the target amongst Local Authorities and RFOs. ACE and
other cultural NDPBs are also working with DCMS to develop strategic partnerships with broadcasters;

Q

Enabling the sector to do more by providing organisations with the right support to be able to reach new
audiences from priority groups effectively;

Q

Using Local Area Agreements and Local Strategic Partnerships more effectively by securing a local performance
indicator for engagement in the arts;

Q

Improving performance management and governance through a new funding agreement between DCMS and
ACE and new corporate planning process at ACE; and

Q

In addition to analysing and disseminating data from the Taking Part survey, DCMS and ACE have commissioned
a new study of the voluntary arts sector to collect data on the engagement opportunities it can offer, and how
it could be better supported.

Museums Target
Increasing the number of people from priority groups accessing museums and galleries collections by 2%. For this
sub-target, priority groups are deﬁned as people with a disability, people from lower socio-economic groups and
people from ethnic minorities.
Description
We are continuing to build on the successful Renaissance in the Regions and the work of the sponsored museums
and galleries programmes in increasing museum visits and broadening audiences. This is being strengthened by
the Strategic Commissioning Partnership Programme, which has helped to encourage closer working with nonDCMS sponsored museums. The aim is to share best practice and develop joint programmes. We are building on the
progress that has been achieved to date by:

Q

Continuing to deliver Renaissance to the Hub museums and so increase the number of visits from priority
groups;

Q

Continuing to encourage sponsored museums and galleries to pursue particular programmes aimed at priority
groups; and

Q

Promoting partnerships between museums and galleries aimed at encouraging participation from priority
groups.

Historic Environment Target
Increasing the number of people from priority groups visiting designated Historic Environment sites by 3%. For this
sub-target, priority groups are deﬁned as people with a disability, people from lower socio-economic groups and
people from ethnic minorities.
Description
The major heritage bodies are developing and implementing a variety of programmes and projects targeted at
priority groups, working collaboratively, sharing best practice and developing partnership programmes. There has
been signiﬁcant progress within the sector, which has included:

Q

DCMS establishing a steering group, comprising the major heritage bodies, to discuss strategy, issues and share
best practice;

Q

The development and implementation of a three-year action plan comprising more than 90 projects and
programmes targeted towards the priority groups; and

Q

Improved partnership working within the sector demonstrated by projects such as the jointly hosted ‘Your Place
or Mine’ conference by National Trust and English Heritage.

Sectoral leader English Heritage has played an important role in its commitment to the target and raising awareness
within the sector. This has been achieved through:

Q

Sharing of best practice and ideas through the Historic Environment Review Executive Committee (HEREC)
Broadening Access meetings;

Q

Speciﬁc projects run by English Heritage, including outreach, education and events programmes;

Q

National projects, including projects run by others but supported through English Heritage’s grant programmes;
and

Q

Using the expansion of Heritage Open Days and the Blue Plaques Scheme to broaden access at the local
community level.

Improve the productivity of the tourism, creative and leisure industries
Performance summary: Slippage
Indicator
For the purposes of this PSA, productivity is estimated for each of the three industries by dividing gross value added
by total employment. Gross value added and total employment are sourced from the Ofﬁce of National Statistics
Annual Business Inquiry. Baselines and targets are reported under two headings: “Tourism and Leisure Related
Industries” and “Creative Industries”. Targets take the form of annual percentage increases in the productivity ﬁgures
higher than those for the service sector as a whole.
Description
DCMS seeks to support this objective at a microeconomic level with projects designed to impact on its sponsored
industries. This takes two forms: research aimed at understanding drivers of performance in the industries and
policies informed by the research and other evidence.
The impact of these projects is measured and assessed through analysis of the contribution both tourism and leisure,
and creative industries make to UK productivity. These projects consist of:

Q

Implementation of the Licensing Act;

Q

Implementation of the Gambling Act;

Q

Digital Switchover implementation;

Q

Tourism projects, including the Tourism Strategy for 2012 and beyond; and

Q

Creative industries projects, including the forthcoming strategy paper on the Creative Economy Programme.

The base year for the data on productivity performance is 2004 and the trends in productivity, including revised
2006 data are shown on the graph below. Additional commentary on this data can be found on pages 29–30.

Section 7: Efﬁciency Review from SR2004
7.1 Efﬁciency Review 2005–08
Final Efﬁciency Savings
Target: £262m of efﬁciency savings in 2007–08 (50% cashable)
Achieved: £301.1m as at 31 March 2008 (71% cashable)
All gains are now classiﬁed as ﬁnal and this report represents the closing of the programme (no further gains will
be reported).
This target is divided into internal DCMS, NDPB and Local Authority savings. We have met our internal target, and
exceeded our NPDB and Local Authority targets.
To deliver the savings, NDPBs identiﬁed a range of different initiatives including:

Q

Staff pay and management (including changes to overtime policy);

Q

Use of the Government Procurement Card (GPC) to make cash savings in procurement;

Q

Shared services (e.g. combined heat and power installation); and

Q

Increased productivity gains (including higher visitor numbers).

All efﬁciency plans were carefully scrutinised to ensure that proposed measures represent genuine efﬁciencies and
not cuts in services. Similarly, different bodies’ outputs are also monitored to ensure that services are not being cut
as a result of the efﬁciency programme.
Examples of speciﬁc measures included:

Q

British Library: User and visitor satisfaction has either been maintained or even improved since the start of the
efﬁciency programme according to surveys; and

Q

UK Sport: Operational savings in drug testing have been made whilst maintaining a constant level of testing.
The annual number of tests has remained at 7,000 over the period.

In April 2007 and April 2008 internal audits of the Department’s Efﬁciency Programme were carried out. Both audits
found that DCMS had good systems in place.
Further details of the Efﬁciency Programme are set out in the Department’s Efﬁciency Technical Note available
on our website9. This shows the savings targets for the different projects that make up the Efﬁciency Programme.
Progress for each of these projects is noted below.

Autumn Performance Report 2008

Data reported in the Departmental Annual Report 2008 were provisional. Further investigation by the Ofﬁce for
National Statistics revealed that the actual outturn for both the creative industries and tourism industries and other
leisure was lower than previously reported. Final data are shown above.
The revised 2006 data show a slight downturn in the productivity trend for the creative industries. The Ofﬁce for
National Statistics (ONS) who produce the underlying data for the target, has advised that the Gross Value Added
(GVA) for businesses whose main activity is classiﬁed as ‘Radio and Television’ is over-estimated. This was corrected
for 2005 and 2006, however the problem also affects years prior to 2004. Any downward revision to the 2002
ﬁgure (the base year for this index) would increase the ﬁgures for all following years, improving the general trend in
comparison to the target. Rough estimates suggest that it might even increase beyond the set target.
Other activities in the Creative Industries show a fall in productivity in advertising, both in employment and GVA
ﬁgures, while there has been an increase in motion picture production, distribution and projection.
For the leisure industries there has been some reasonable productivity growth, particularly in the physical well-being
activities (such as ﬁtness centres, saunas, solariums etc) and other recreational activities, along with some parts of
the tourism industry such as hotels and other tourist accommodation. However, this is counteracted by a reduction
in the productivity of travel agencies/tour operators caused by large decreases in both employment and GVA.
The limitations of the measurement of this PSA are explained in the target’s Technical Note. In particular, we use
low-level results which are more prone to sampling variation, meaning that some ﬂuctuations remain in the data.
These may indeed be correct but it is nevertheless advisable to consider the trend and averages over several years,
rather than solely the change between any two particular years.
Other PSAs
All other SR2002 PSAs were reported on for the ﬁnal time in our Departmental Annual Report 2007, which can be

Section 9: Public Accounts Committee Recommendations
9.1 Session 2007-08: Forty-Second Report
Preparing for Sporting Success at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and Beyond
Recommendations & Conclusions

Response

The Department has yet to begin raising the £100m it
needs from the private sector to fund elite sport, even
though we ﬁrst raised concerns about the size of this
challenge nearly two years ago. The Department plans
to start its fundraising after the Beijing 2008 Games,
although it could not say what it had to offer to attract
private sector donors, or provide any guarantees that the
money would be raised. The Department should work
with its advisors to develop ﬁrm proposals for how it
will attract private sector donors and in what timeframe
it would be realistic to obtain ﬁrm commitments.

In our initial response, we referred to the ‘Medal Hopes’
scheme, that would enable businesses and individuals
to help realise the potential of those athletes on UK
Sport’s World Class Performance Pathway.
Update
In Beijing DCMS trailed ‘Medal Hopes’ to let British
business know that there would be an exciting
opportunity to support those athletes on UK Sport’s
World Class Performance Pathway.
Since then DCMS have been working with Fast Track
Sales Ltd and UK Sport to develop Medal Hopes as
a marketable sponsorship product with deliverable
rights. The Medal Hopes brand will support a range
of programmes giving national, regional and local
companies the chance to become associated with
our top sportspeople and allow us to maximise the
commercial exploitation of our success in Beijing. DCMS
believe Medal Hopes will be attractive to businesses,
helping to raise their proﬁle, position their brand and
meet their corporate social responsibilities – whilst also
delivering funds to help our athletes to future success.
DCMS know that there has been interest and those lines
of enquiry are being pursued.
Medal Hopes will be led by UK Sport in partnership with
the National Governing Bodies of sport. We expect the
scheme to be ofﬁcially launched shortly.

UK Sport is due to give sports the ﬁrst £20m of the
money to be raised from the private sector during
2008-09, but it has yet to receive funds to enable it to
do so. If the Department cannot raise the full £100m or
it is raised too late, then the Great Britain teams’ medal
chances at the London 2012 Games could be harmed.
UK Sport should identify what action it will take in the
2008-09 ﬁnancial year to address any shortfall, including
how individual sports will be affected. In developing its
contingency plans, it should seek to protect the funding
of those sports most likely to win medals at the London
2012 Games.

As per the initial response, DCMS and UK Sport accept
the Committee’s recommendation and UK Sport has
already acted upon it, undertaking contingency planning
in the event of any shortfall of private funding.
Furthermore, in June 2008, UK Sport published its 10
guiding Principles for Investment for the 2009–13
Funding Cycle. These ensure that resources are targeted
primarily at those sports and athletes most likely to win
medals at London 2012.
Update
DCMS remains committed to giving our elite athletes
the best possible preparation for London 2012 and
conﬁrmed to UK Sport in October that it would meet
the shortfall on funding for the ﬁnancial year 2008–09,
up to a maximum of £20m. UK Sport will continue to
focus its conﬁrmed funding upon those sports most
likely to deliver medal success in London 2012 and
achieve the ambitious Olympic and Paralympic medal
table targets.

31

Autumn Performance Report 2008

32

Concerns about what funding will be available have
created uncertainty for the sports governing bodies,
making it harder for them to plan ahead on the basis of
ﬁrm ﬁnancial commitments. After the Beijing Games in
2008, UK Sport should share with sports its contingency
plans in the event of a shortfall in funding. To help sports
to plan up to London 2012, it should discuss with each
sport how its funding might be affected, based on upto-date assessments of how much of the £100m will
be raised.

Our earlier response discussed the investment principles
and key performance indicators including the medal
targets for London 2012 that would be set against the
funding.

The Department and UK Sport’s medal table goals at
the London Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012 are
demanding and UK Sport acknowledges that meeting
them will require a step change in the performance of
athletes. The Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games
later this year will provide a key indicator of progress
towards UK Sport’s medal table goals for the London
2012 Games. UK Sport should within six months of the
Beijing Games, publish an action plan setting out how
it will address any weaknesses in the performance of
the Great Britain teams. It should set out clearly what
impact its assessment of performance at Beijing has on
the medal targets set overall, and for individual sports
for the London 2012 Games. UK Sport should also make
clear the consequences of any changes it makes to
targets on its funding allocations.

The previous response referred to UK Sport undertaking
performance reviews with all sports in autumn 2008
to ensure funding levels are appropriate and to make
adjustments accordingly.

Following our 2006 Report, UK Sport has agreed a
broader range of targets to measure its own performance,
all of which it has comfortably exceeded, indicating
that the targets set were not sufﬁciently stretching.
The performance targets UK Sport has agreed with the
Department are set at the level of 75% of the targets
it sets for individual sports. We do not consider that
agreeing targets at 75% of the level it sets for others
is satisfactory as an indicator of UK Sport’s own
performance. In the new Funding Agreement covering
the period April 2008 to March 2011, UK Sport and the
Department should agree targets for UK Sport at the
same level as the aggregate of the targets for individual
sports.

The original response stated that DCMS and UK Sport
would agree an appropriate percentage level for UK
Sport’s overall targets for each year of competition
bearing in mind PAC recommendations.

The Department is aiming to secure a sustained
improvement in sports participation before and after
the London 2012 Games, but there is no conclusive
evidence that winning Olympic and Paralympic medals
inﬂuences levels of participation in the community. The
Department has a target for two million more people
to participate in a sport or physical activity by 2012. It
should review existing evidence on how elite sporting
success impacts on sports participation and undertake
new research where there are gaps in the evidence. In the
light of this research, it should work with UK Sport and
the home country sports councils to develop an action
plan on how it will use sporting success at the London
2012 Games to improve levels of sports participation
before, during and after the Games.

Our earlier response referred to DCMS issuing an
invitation to tender as part of our Joint Research
Programme, the purpose of which is to more generally
understand participation across all our sectors.

Update
UK Sport’s Board met on 2 December 2008 and agreed
full four year funding allocations to the 19 Olympic
and 14 Paralympic sports. The remaining eight Olympic
and four Paralympic sports will receive a core level of
public funding, which will be topped up as and when
the private sector money comes on stream. Additional
funding will be allocated by UK Sport to sports in line
with their no compromise approach.

Update
UK Sport has completed these reviews as part of the
Mission 2012 process for the third quarter of 2008/2009.
UK Sport published the conﬁrmed funding for 19
Olympic and 14 Paralympic sports on 3 December and
also the high level medal targets for London 2012.

Update
The consolidated performance targets for the remaining
period of the Funding Agreement 2008–11 will be
ﬁnalised and agreed by 31 March 2009. The consolidated
target will be based upon the targets for each sport for
the period.

We also referred to UK Sport conducting its own
“Sporting Preferences” survey of the general public. At
the time the follow-up post Beijing was underway.
Update
On the Joint Research Programme, DCMS is close
to selecting a research consortium to carry our a
fundamental review of the participation research and
existing data under our new Culture and Sport Evidence
joint programme with the key sector bodies.
The Sporting Preferences survey is now complete
and the results will be published in the second half of
December 2008.

Autumn Performance Report 2008

UK Sport believes elite athletes can act as role models
and inspire young people from all walks of life to take
up sport. It holds no data on the background of the
1,400 elite athletes it currently funds, however, and told
us it did not consider the information to be relevant.
We believe, on the contrary, that this information would
provide a clearer picture of who is receiving public
funding, and be a basis for identifying opportunities
for the Department, UK Sport and the home country
sports councils to work together to increase the sociodemographic spread of athletes in some sports, from
grass roots to elite participation. In common with other
lottery distributors, UK Sport should collect data on the
socio-economic and educational backgrounds of the
athletes it funds and we ﬁnd the refusal to do so both
unjustiﬁed and disturbing.

The earlier response indicated that UK Sport held
background data on the gender, age, ethnicity and
disability of the 1400 WCPP elite athletes it currently
funds, but not educational background

UK Sport is aiming to establish a world class system
of support for elite athletes which will last beyond
2012. Its success in doing so will depend on its ability
to work effectively in partnership with a range of other
parties in the public, private and voluntary sectors. The
Department should establish a steering group to coordinate the activities of all those seeking to deliver
its sporting objectives before, during and after the
London 2012 Games. The group’s remit should be to
exploit opportunities for its members to work together
on initiatives to maximise the sporting beneﬁts and
legacy of host nation status. A key objective should
be to enhance the links between grass roots and high
performance sport so as to make the most of the
opportunity presented by the increased spending on
both sports participation and elite athletes.

The initial response stated the intention to establish a
new Sports Legacy Board, chaired by the Minister for
Sport. The ﬁrst meeting was due to be convened later
in autumn 2008.

DCMS and UK Sport accepted that such info might be
useful for wider sports policy purposes and agree to add
in an educational background question to the UK Sport
annual athlete survey. The survey was due to take place
in November 2008, with the ﬁnal report published by
March 2009.
Update
UK Sport’s annual athlete survey has been postponed
until early 2009 with indicative results still due to
be available in March 2009. A question relating to
educational background will be included.

Update
Key stakeholders have been invited to join the Sports
Legacy Board and arrangements are being put in place
to hold the ﬁrst meeting early in 2009.

9.2 Session 2007-08: Fiftieth Report
Preparations for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games
Recommendations & Conclusions

Response

The Department and Olympic Delivery Authority could
come under pressure to change plans and designs
as legacy and security requirements are ﬁrmed up,
and in the light of the Beijing Games. The more the
2012 programme progresses, the harder it will be to
incorporate changes without generating additional
costs and delays, and, possibly, squeezing out legacy
requirements. The Department and the Olympic Delivery
Authority should be clear about the cost and funding of
proposed changes, their impact on the programme and
the assessment criteria to be used.

In the original response, the Department stated that the
Home Ofﬁce would deliver to Ministers an overarching
costed security plan by the end of this year. The delivery
of the costed plan will be rigorously managed to ensure
compliance with the £600m funding allocation which
is in addition to the ODA’s £354m budget for providing
security during construction.
Update
The Home Ofﬁce has now delivered a draft of the costed
security plan for stakeholder consultation. A revised
costed security plan will be submitted for Ministerial
endorsement early in 2009.

Autumn Performance Report 2008

Despite the previous recommendations of the Committee,
effective programme management arrangements are
not yet in place. Three years after London was awarded
the Games, the Department’s programme planning
and risk management arrangements are still not fully
developed. The arrangements, which the Department
now expects to be fully embedded by the end of 2008,
should include:

Our original response referred to an overarching
Programme Plan developed by the Government Olympic
Executive bringing together the plans and activities of
the delivery organisations, enabling the identiﬁcation
of dependencies, overlaps, gaps, complexity and critical
path activities, and thus exposing areas of risk. The ﬁrst
version of the plan was submitted to the Olympic Board
in September 2008.
