Welsh Affairs Committee

Introduction
The Government welcomes the Committee’s report into broadband services in Wales.
The Government is grateful to the Committee for its consideration of the state of
broadband access in Wales, the particular challenges faced by users in Wales, and
the work of the UK and Welsh Governments to improve access and roll out superfast
broadband, based on written and oral evidence from key stakeholders.
The Government has carefully considered all the recommendations suggested by the
Committee and is pleased to be able to present its response.

Welsh Affairs Committee

The Government’s Approach
The Government recognises the economic growth potential of broadband and has
made available £530m to stimulate private investment to take superfast broadband to
90% of UK premises and basic broadband coverage to virtually everyone else at a
speed of at least 2Mbps. It has also allocated a further £150m to support the
development of super-connected cities which will have ultrafast broadband and high
speed wireless internet access. This support, in addition to commercially-led
deployment by the private sector, is aimed at delivering our key ambition of having the
best superfast broadband network in Europe by 2015.
The Government’s approach is for procurement to take place at a local level. In Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK) has developed
approaches with the Devolved Administrations to ensure that the local broadband
plans will meet the Government’s overall target. This approach leverages local and
European funding, and as a result over £1bn of public funds in total will be invested in
delivering broadband to remote and rural areas, together with significant funding from
the commercial sector. Wales has received £56.9m from the UK Government’s
broadband investment fund to deliver superfast broadband, in addition to investment
from the Welsh Government, European Structural Funds and the private sector.
The current Government’s approach is to support the extension of fibre deeper into the
network, including the transmission network (backhaul/middle mile) where this is a
bottleneck. The Government has sought to encourage infrastructure competition
through providing funding to stimulate private investment in locations where the
commercial investment case is weak and would be unlikely to happen at all without
subsidy. We are also determined that remote, rural areas that currently do not have
access to broadband are not left behind, and our strategy includes plans to deliver
broadband to these areas via a variety of technology solutions.
However, broadband is not just about fixed location usage and just fibre technology.
Wireless technologies have an important role in both extending coverage, providing a
wider choice of services and also provide mobile broadband services. Government
recognise the important contribution mobile broadband can play in enabling a fully
connected experience for citizens and have taken steps to ensure that more spectrum
is made available to support the development of 4G mobile services. After
consultations, Ofcom is commencing the auction process for 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz
spectrum, both bands being suitable for 4G services, and we expect the auction will
take place soon. But the demand for mobile services shows no sign of slowing and
many are predicting the exponential growth in data consumption that indicates that
more spectrum may be needed. For that reason Government has also committed to
releasing 500 MHz of spectrum below 5GHz, suitable for wireless broadband services,
by 2020, to ensure that as it is needed there is sufficient spectrum to enable demand
to be met. It is a challenging target but work is underway and the first spectrum
releases should take place by 2014.
The Government are supporting the programme of investment with a series of policy
and regulatory interventions that will lower the cost of deployment for commercial

Welsh Affairs Committee

providers and provide greater certainty to allow the market to invest. The Government
recently announced that:





broadband street cabinets and other infrastructure (such as overhead
infrastructure) can be installed without the need for prior approval from the
local council (except in Sites of Special Scientific Interest);
broadband companies will face less cost and bureaucracy in laying cables in
streets; and;
broadband cables and cabinets can be installed on or under private land
without the bureaucratic burden of long-running negotiations.
Government will broker a new deal for the installation of broadband with
industry and highway authorities to ensure that traffic regulation does not
hinder the roll out of superfast broadband

These measures will tackle issues that are costing communications providers time and
money, delaying the roll out of superfast broadband to the areas that need it most. We
will be bringing forward these measures as soon as possible, following consultation
where necessary. These measures are, however, a combination of devolved and
reserved matters: planning changes, for example, are a devolved issue in Wales,
whereas changes to the Electronic Communications Code are reserved.
We believe that this approach of both supporting investment and implementing policy
and regulatory interventions will enable the commercial market to deploy superfast
broadband to as many households as is commercially viable, as well as providing
support in areas where the commercial investment case is challenging. By enabling
local authorities to take control of investments in their area, we maximise public and
private investment whilst ensuring local needs are taken into consideration.

The Government’s Response to the
Recommendations
1.
Over a number of years, the availability of broadband has been
consistently lower in Wales than the UK average. However, according to Ofcom,
that gap has narrowed in recent years following investment by the private sector
and through the efforts of the Welsh Government. We are concerned, however,
that Ofcom figures for 2012 show that the gap between Wales and the UK has
widened again. This demonstrates that it is imperative that Wales continues to
receive the funding and political leadership to ensure that broadband provision
is at the very least in line with the rest of the UK. We will continue to monitor
progress in this area throughout the remainder of this Parliament. (Paragraph
20)
The UK Government’s plans to speed up the roll-out of superfast broadband will
benefit the whole of the UK, including Wales. The BDUK gap funding model for Wales
estimated the requirement to deliver 90% superfast broadband and 2Mbps to
remaining users to be £56.9m. This reflects the investment required to deliver
broadband to remote, rural areas of Wales.

2.
While we welcome efforts to improve broadband coverage in Wales, we
are concerned that, particularly in rural areas, the existence of broadband
notspots and slowspots has hindered existing businesses and has deterred new
businesses from choosing to locate there at some cost to the local economy.
Eradicating remaining broadband notspots and slowspots in Wales must be a
priority for the UK and Welsh Governments. (Paragraph 28)
The UK Government shares the Committee’s view that eradicating notspots and
slowspots is an important priority to support local businesses and stimulate growth.
This is why the UK Government has allocated £530m – including £56.9m in Wales – to
help roll out superfast broadband to those areas not covered by commercial suppliers.
Our approach to provide 90% of homes and businesses with superfast broadband and
the remaining users with 2Mbps minimum will tackle the problems of both notspots
and slowspots across the UK.

3.
We welcome the efforts by the Welsh Government, working with
commercial providers, to bring broadband to areas of Wales for the first time.
However, the Welsh Government's Regional Innovative Broadband Support
scheme only provided a minimum download speed of 0.5 mbps, which soon
proved inadequate to businesses and consumers. (Paragraph 34)
The UK Government also welcomes the work by the Welsh Government to increase
broadband access to more isolated parts of Wales. Our investment plans will ensure

Welsh Affairs Committee

that everyone in the UK will have access to a minimum of 2Mbps; we welcome the
Welsh Government’s plans to continue to improve users’ speeds beyond 0.5Mbps.

4.
The Broadband Support Scheme has also experienced problems. We call
on the Welsh Government to ensure that the Broadband Support Scheme
reaches as many people as possible and is adequately advertised and that the
application process for grants from the scheme is made as easy as possible to
complete. (Paragraph 35)
This is a matter for the Welsh Government. The UK Government would encourage the
Welsh Government to do all it can to make it easy for people to access high speed
broadband.

5.
We welcome the Government's award of funding to Cardiff to enable it to
develop superfast broadband which will bring significant economic benefits to
that city. It is vital to the economy of Wales that investment in urban broadband
is extended beyond Cardiff and we call on the Wales Office to prioritise support
for Swansea's bid for "super connected" status. (Paragraph 41)
The UK Government welcomes the wide range of cities – including Swansea – that bid
for ‘super-connected city’ funding from the second phase of BDUK’s Urban Broadband
Fund. The successful bidders will be announced in the autumn.

6.
The UK Government has pledged to provide the UK with the best
broadband in Europe by providing access to superfast broadband for 90% of the
UK by 2015. The Welsh Government's target is even more stretching and
includes a commitment to provide Welsh businesses access to next-generation
broadband at a minimum speed of 30 mbps by "the middle of 2016". Both of
these targets are extremely ambitious. The two Governments will deserve great
credit if they are achieved. (Paragraph 48)
The UK Government thanks the Committee for its conclusion. Our ambitious targets
reflect the importance of improved broadband provision to the country’s prosperity and
our plans to stimulate economic growth. While there is no room for complacency, we
are confident that our plans are progressing well.

7.
We are concerned that too much focus may have been placed on the rollout of superfast broadband at the expense of ensuring that the needs of those
without any broadband service at all are met. The first priority must be to ensure
that the needs of the approximately 90,000 homes in Wales which currently do
not have access to broadband are addressed as soon as possible. The

7

8

Welsh Affairs Committee

Government's ambitions for superfast broadband must not be at the expense of
delivering a good broadband service for all. (Paragraph 49)
The UK Government’s investment will deliver superfast broadband to 90% of the UK
and a minimum of 2Mbps everywhere else. Our ambitions to deliver superfast
broadband will not be at the expense of those without access; in Wales specifically,
our provision of £56.9m to deliver access for the thousands of users who currently
have none demonstrates our commitment to providing a minimum service to the whole
country. Our focus on providing superfast broadband for 90% of the UK is vital to
support the businesses that rely on this level of service, and will begin to future-proof
the country’s broadband infrastructure.

8.
We are concerned that the Welsh Government's scheme appears already
to be behind schedule. The contract for the provider of the scheme was awarded
some four months after the planned date. Any further delay to the programme
will put the Government's timetable in jeopardy. (Paragraph 50)
The Welsh Government’s scheme is ready to progress once State aid clearance has
been provided for the project (which we anticipate being confirmed shortly). All other
preparation has been completed ahead of implementation.

9.
We encourage the Welsh Government to examine the UK Government's
plans to enable broadband street cabinets and other infrastructure to be
installed without the need for prior approval from the local authority (except in
Sites of Special Scientific Interest). The Welsh Government should consider
whether these measures are appropriate to Wales. (Paragraph 51)
Speeding up the installation of broadband street cabinets and other infrastructure, as
we announced on 7 September, is a key part of our plans to roll out superfast
broadband across the UK, including Wales. As a devolved matter, it will be for the
Welsh Government to consider whether this is appropriate at this time.

10.
BT currently exercises significant market power in the provision of fixed
broadband services in Wales. This market power must be regulated effectively
because only with effective competition in the provision of broadband will
choice be provided to consumers and the market able to operate efficiently to
deliver to everyone across the country. While we welcome Ofcom's efforts to
open up the access to BT's ducts and poles in Wales to other providers, we are
concerned that it has not yet gone far enough in ensuring access is available at
a reasonable cost. We call on Ofcom to increase its efforts in this area.
(Paragraph 56)
While this is a matter for Ofcom as an independent regulator, the UK Government
welcomes the work by Ofcom and BT to open up access to its ducts and poles. This

Welsh Affairs Committee

sits alongside our own plans to cut red tape and speed up the deployment of
broadband infrastructure, for example removing unnecessary bureaucracy around the
installation of street cabinets and overhead telecoms lines.

11.
Broadband services in Wales can only be made available to the most
remote parts of Wales through a mix of technologies including mobile. Mobile
broadband is the fastest growing means of accessing the internet in Wales and
this trend is likely to continue. The delayed Spectrum auction, now planned for
2013, must ensure that 4G mobile services are available to at least 98% of
people in Wales. (Paragraph 69)
The UK Government agrees that mobile broadband is an important tool in delivering
broadband access to remote communities, and is a key part of our commitment to
providing the digital infrastructure needed to support businesses. On 2 October, the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Maria Miller, met with the UK’s four
main mobile operators and agreed a faster timetable for the spectrum auction and
launch of 4G services. Ofcom will run the auction later this year, and mobile operators
will be rolling out 4G services in the first half of 2013, six months earlier than previous
estimates. The auction will include one licence with a coverage obligation to provide
indoor coverage for 98% of the UK and 95% of each of the Nations. However, given
the anticipated competition between licence winners, the 95% obligation is not
necessarily the maximum coverage.

12.
Satellite broadband is a practical alternative to fixed line and mobile
broadband. Although we received conflicting evidence regarding the
performance and cost of satellite broadband, we received very persuasive
evidence that for very difficult-to-reach areas it might be the best solution for
Wales, as it has been for Scotland. We recommend that Ofcom undertake a
study to evaluate whether satellite broadband should be supported more
vigorously in Wales. (Paragraph 70)
The UK Government is aware of the benefits and drawbacks of using satellite
broadband, in terms of cost, latency and bandwidth availability. Satellite broadband is
currently unlikely to provide the superfast speeds (above 24Mbps) we plan to deliver to
90% of the UK. However, we acknowledge and agree with the Committee’s conclusion
that satellite is likely to have an important role to play in reaching remote areas in the
UK, including in some parts Wales. Satellite broadband is already available
commercially, and deciding on its use as part of any subsidy programme would be a
decision for the Welsh Government. We understand that the Welsh Government has
made provision for the use of satellite through one of its contracts.

13.
There is a little over two years for the Government to deliver on its pledge
to provide the UK with the best broadband in Europe. For Wales, broadband will
become an increasingly important generator of economic success and a means

9

10

Welsh Affairs Committee

of addressing social exclusion. The task before the Government is therefore
significant and if they are to succeed the programmes of both the UK and Welsh
Governments must be implemented without delay. (Paragraph 71)
The UK Government agrees with the Committee’s recommendation – the delivery of
superfast broadband is vital to encouraging economic growth and supporting
businesses in Wales and the rest of the UK. Our rapid delivery timetable reflects this.

14.
The Government must ensure that its ambition to roll-out superfast
broadband does not undermine efforts to ensure that a basic broadband service
is available to premises in Wales that currently have no service at all.
(Paragraph 72)
As mentioned in the response to recommendation 7, the UK Government’s investment
will deliver superfast broadband to 90% of the UK and a minimum of 2Mbps
everywhere else. The funding allocated to improve broadband access in remote, rural
areas of Wales will help us deliver on our aim to provide all premises in the UK with
this minimum service level.

15.
The Government and Ofcom must ensure that there is a level playing field
for broadband providers and competing technologies to ensure that the
broadband market in Wales is as competitive as possible. To that end, the
Spectrum Auction must proceed without further delay. We will continue to
monitor the broadband strategies of both the UK and Welsh Governments over
the course of this Parliament. (Paragraph 73)
While competition within the market is a matter for Ofcom, the UK Government’s
broadband strategy supports a number of different technologies – including fixed,
wireless and satellite – to deliver superfast broadband. The current UK broadband
market is one of the most competitive in the world, and the roll-out of further
infrastructure will further benefit consumers. As mentioned above, the 4G spectrum
auction will now be taking place later this year, allowing mobile operators to roll out 4G
services in the first half of 2013
