Foreword: Getting the balance right
A reputation for integrity
British gambling has a worldwide reputation for integrity. It is a diverse, vibrant and
innovative industry and a popular, everyday leisure pursuit for many millions of
adults.
Regulation dating from the 1960s has ensured that we have a tightly controlled and
well-run industry.
Modernisation
But the law on gambling is now out of date. It no longer reflects the society in
which we live, and has not been able to keep up with developments in technology.
The gambling industry suffers from a lot of out-of-date restrictions, like those that
stop casinos being built except in a few permitted areas. There are unnecessary
restrictions on bingo and British businesses are prevented from offering gaming on
the Internet, leaving the market to foreign competitors who may not be regulated
properly. The law needs to be modernised.
Properly managed and run, gambling can create wealth and jobs. It can be part of an
attractive leisure environment in towns and cities.
But in modernising, we need to strike the right balance between economic gain and
social protection. We must make sure crime is kept out of gambling and that
gambling is conducted in ways that are fair to the consumer. In particular, we must
take the strongest steps to protect children and vulnerable adults from being harmed
or exploited by gambling.
These are to be the aims of the draft Gambling Bill.
The Gambling Commission
The draft clauses published now focus on the establishment of a modern regulator,
the Gambling Commission.
The Commission will have wider functions, greater flexibility to act and stronger
enforcement powers than the existing Gaming Board for Great Britain that it will
replace.
The Commission will ensure best practice across each sector of the gambling
industry, using policy statements, codes of practice and guidance to drive progress.
Commission codes of practice, in particular, will be an important feature of the new
legislation, enabling the Commission to respond to changing circumstances
whenever issues of consumer protection arise.
The clauses also outline the principle licensing functions of the Gambling
Commission – namely the licensing of various gambling operations and key
personnel. The Commission will have flexibility to impose general or individual
conditions on classes of licences and, where necessary, on specific operators. It will

4

also have powers to review licences, for example where it believes conditions have
been breached or where it believes the licence holder is no longer suitable. It will also
have extensive enforcement powers to tackle illegal gambling.
The Commission will be a strong regulator, but with the flexibility to measure
carefully its controls.
Scrutiny of our proposals
Reform of the law on gambling has already been the subject of a number of public
consultations, during the work of the independent Gambling Review Body (led by Sir
Alan Budd), following its report and when the Government published its response “A
safe bet for success” (Cmnd 5397) in March 2002.
I therefore now publish this first package of draft clauses. I will present a complete
draft Bill to Parliament in the autumn for pre-legislative scrutiny.
Inevitably, the draft clauses published today are not necessarily in the form they will
take when the whole Bill is presented for scrutiny in the autumn. Work will continue
on the rest of the Bill, and there will be improvements that necessitate changes to
the material published here. But, I have decided to publish this package of draft
clauses at this point, since I wish to involve the public and industry at every stage of
the process.
There is, I believe, already a wide consensus that modernisation is needed. Prelegislative scrutiny will improve our proposals. I hope too that it will build
parliamentary understanding and public confidence in reform, enabling us to strike
the right balance between deregulation and the protection of young and vulnerable
people.

Policy background
1.

The need for change

1.1

The gambling scene in Great Britain is very diverse. There is a long tradition
of fixed odds betting, centred on horse racing but now extending to a wide
range of sporting and other events. We have casinos, commercial bingo clubs,
machine arcades, lotteries and the National Lottery. Below the threshold of
commercially organised gambling there is wide range of what might be called
social gambling, including simple low-stake gaming in pubs and clubs.

Changes since the 1960s
1.2

The laws regulating gambling for the most part date from the 1960s, and
include provisions that are much older than that. Over recent years these
laws have come under increasing strain. In part this is due to a shift in public
attitudes towards gambling. It has become more socially acceptable, with
about two out of three people playing the National Lottery regularly. More
people have become more willing to see gambling as part of the mainstream
of leisure activity, whereas the law treats it as something to be, at best,
grudgingly tolerated. Some of the key elements of the current system of
regulation have come to be seen as imposing unnecessary restrictions on the
ability of business to meet consumers’ wishes.

1.3

Another driver for change is technology. Gambling legislation was prepared
before technology had transformed the way in which information can be
processed, visually represented and communicated. One consequence has
been that, while people in Great Britain can lawfully go on the Internet to use
gaming sites based abroad, there is no provision for British operators to
provide well-regulated alternatives. Another is that betting has been able to
take new forms and use new media for which the law currently provides
inadequate regulation in terms of fairness for participants and protection for
the vulnerable.

1.4

Other problems with the present law have also become increasingly pressing.
It is inflexible, in the sense that much of the regulatory detail is prescribed in
statute, and cannot readily be modified to respond to developments in what
is a highly innovative and fast-moving industry – even though the industry
and the Gaming Board have done a lot of valuable work on codes of practice
in a number of areas. In addition, while it has set out minimum ages for
participation in gambling the law has not incorporated any kind of systematic
protection for the vulnerable or provision to ensure that all businesses
providing gambling apply high standards of social responsibility.

1.5

Against this background the Government decided in 1999 to appoint an
independent committee, chaired by Sir Alan Budd, to review gambling law
and regulation. The committee reported in July 2001. It made 176
recommendations. Following public consultation on the report the
Government published a White Paper in March 2002 (“A safe bet for success”
Cmnd 5397) setting out its conclusions, and confirming its intention to
implement the great majority of the recommendations. It has already taken

6

action on all those that do not require primary legislation and which can be
taken forward without upsetting the balance of regulation or distorting
competition.
Principles of reform
1.6

The Government’s aim is to update Britain’s gambling law and to ensure that
it provides a new, effective and flexible balance of regulation. The Bill is
intended to sweep away restrictions, like those that prevent betting on tracks
on particular days, that are no longer needed or which reflect assumptions
about the way in which gambling has to take place that are no longer valid.
At the same time it will strengthen safeguards that are lacking. There will
then be in place a regulatory framework that will meet properly the needs of
everyone involved in gambling, whether as a provider or a consumer.

2.

A unified framework of regulation

2.1

The numerous arrangements for licensing gambling clearly do not fit today's
market - where operators frequently provide a variety of products with
entirely different licensing arrangements. A unified, focused regulator can
administer licensing more effectively.

Three objectives for a new regulator
2.2

The draft clauses being published will modernise and simplify regulation.
They provide for the creation of a single regulatory authority for gambling the Gambling Commission. The Commission will have three key objectives:
x To prevent gambling from being a source of crime and disorder;
x To ensure that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way; and
x To protect children and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or
exploited by gambling.

2.3

These objectives are central to the scheme of licensing. They explain why we
regulate gambling. They are defined precisely in clause 1 of the published
clauses.

2.4

It is proposed that the Gambling Commission will operate at arms-length
from Government and that as far as possible it should be self-funding. It is
anticipated that the Commission will accordingly be set up as a nondepartmental public body (NDPB).

Functions of the Commission
2.5

The Commission will have an overall remit to regulate gambling. It will take
over the licensing and regulatory responsibilities of the current Gaming Board
for Great Britain (GBGB) in relation to casinos, bingo and certain types of
lotteries.

7

2.6

It will also take over from the GBGB the responsibility for regulating the sale,
supply and maintenance of gaming machines, and will have additional
responsibilities in relation to their manufacture.

2.7

In addition, the Commission will assume responsibility for:
x Betting operators; and
x Pools promoters.

2.8

The Commission will, for the first time, license and regulate gaming by
means of remote technology. The Commission will issue licences for Internet
gambling and all other forms of remote gambling, including interactive
television and mobile telephony.

2.9

Following the implementation of proposals in the draft clauses, any operator
considering a new business will therefore be able to seek permission from the
Gambling Commission for licences to provide facilities for the full range of
commercial gambling activities. Where granted, operating licences will be
subject to compliance with the conditions of the licence and the payment of
an annual fee. Application fees and annual fees will be set by the Secretary of
State in secondary legislation, and will vary according to the type of gambling
conducted pursuant to the licence.

2.10

Certain gambling activities, such as permits for lower stake gaming machines,
will continue to be regulated entirely by local authorities. Other activities,
such as gaming or lotteries at a bazaar or fete, are considered to be of
minimal risk to the public and therefore not to require a regulator. There are
two areas of gambling that will not be covered by the Commission:
x Spread betting: The Government accepted the Review Body's conclusion
that responsibility for spread betting should remain with the Financial
Services Authority (FSA) for the time being but this will be kept under
review; and
x The National Lottery: The licensing and regulation of the National Lottery
were outside the Review Body's terms of reference. The regulation of the
National Lottery has been separately considered in the DCMS
consultation document on the Review of Lottery licensing and regulation
issued in June 2002. The DCMS decision document issued in July 2003
concluded that because of its responsibility for returns to good causes,
the National Lottery should continue to be regulated by the National
Lottery Commission (NLC).

Licensing
2.11

The new approach to licensing gambling has three elements: operating,
personal and premises licences. The Gambling Commission will issue
operating and personal licences. Local authorities will license gambling
premises in their area. The draft clauses set the framework within which the
Commission will pursue its responsibilities.

2.12

The Commission will determine its own policy and procedures for its
licensing and regulatory functions. In preparing that policy, the Commission

8

must first consult a range of interests - including the Secretary of State, local
authorities, Chief Officers of Police, the gambling industry, organisations
concerned with problem gambling, and, as appropriate, the public.
2.13

The Commission will license gambling operators and certain types of
gambling industry staff. It will have powers to undertake such enquiries as
are necessary in order to reach decisions in connection with individual licence
applications. These powers are designed to ensure that only suitable and
competent persons are licensed to provide gambling to the public.

2.14

The Commission will be able to investigate applicants through interviews, by
requiring the production of criminal records certificates and a number of
other mechanisms. It will also be able to receive information from enhanced
criminal records disclosures and exchange information, using statutory
gateways, with law enforcement and regulatory bodies.

2.15

The Commission will also issue guidance to local authorities on the principles
to be applied in exercising functions under the Act (such as determining
applications for premises licences or certain permits).

Flexibility
2.16

Flexibility will be one of the key characteristics of the new regime. Much of
the detail of existing gambling regulation is set out in primary and secondary
legislation. There will, of course, be a continuing need to set out some of the
detail in this way in the Bill. Nevertheless, experience has taught us that the
evolution of technology and innovation can easily outpace Parliament’s
capacity to bring about further reform. Nor is legislation always the best
way to pursue best practice - legislation can set direct rules, but a code can
explain the improved standards that operators should aim to achieve.

2.17

Therefore the published draft clauses are very precise in describing what
gambling regulation is for - what we as a society need it to protect. They
also delineate clearly the powers of the Commission, the rights of individuals
and the proper role of Parliament in setting the limits of regulation and
burdens on businesses. But within such limits, the draft Bill provides
flexibility to cope with changing circumstances and to continually seek to
improve standards of performance and social responsibility.

2.18

We will be able to respond more effectively to changing circumstances.
Rather than putting limits and the details of entitlements in primary
legislation, the draft Bill allows for such matters to be amended through
secondary legislation.

2.19

The Commission’s tools in tackling such challenges will be the ability to
attach conditions to operating and personal licences, and its ability to issue
codes of practice following consultation with industry and other interests.
The Commission will have flexibility to attach conditions focussed not just on
classes of licence holders, but if it judges necessary, on individual licensees.

2.20

Codes of practice will also be a central feature of the new framework. Codes
are not, of course, in themselves a new feature of gambling regulation. The
industry has long since developed such codes voluntarily, working with the

9

Government, the Gaming Board and other regulators to improve their
approach to a variety of issues. The draft Bill will bring this valuable work
within the regulatory framework. Whilst the Commission will no doubt wish
to look afresh at each issue, the work already done in a number of areas will
inform its views. The Commission will consult with a range of interests
before issuing a code. A code of social responsibility is likely to be an early
priority. The breach of a relevant code of practice will be able to be admitted
as evidence of breach of a licence condition, so it will be in the interests of all
to participate in their development.
2.21

The Commission will also be able to undertake reviews of operating licences
(whether individual licences or classes of licence). Such reviews may result in
adjustment to the scope of a licence or the attachment of new conditions.
Equally, operators may apply for a variation to their licence to expand the
authorised activities or remove conditions, so it will not always be necessary
to make an entirely new application.

2.22

The draft Bill, when published in full, will also provide for appeals by
operators against decisions made by the Gambling Commission in exercise of
its various licensing and enforcement functions. There will also be provision
for a system of premises licensing by local authorities, also with facility for
appeals. These appeals mechanisms and other provisions will ensure that
gambling regulation complies fully with human rights legislation

Advice to the Government
2.23

One of the Gambling Commission’s key functions will be to provide advice to
the Government on the success and social impact of reforming the law on
gambling. The Commission will be able to offer its advice whether or not it
has been requested to do so by the Government.

2.24

The Government views this proposal as a key element of its reforms.

2.25

The draft Bill, when published in full, will allow adults some additional
opportunities to gamble. Gambling operators will of course want to take
advantage of the degree of liberalisation offered by the Bill, and there will
very likely be an expansion of facilities available in different parts of Great
Britain. But the relaxations proposed are definitely not a ‘free for all’ – as
they have sometimes been wrongly described. There will be important
limitations – for example, there will be no expansion of the gambling
available in normal social spaces, like hotels, pubs and restaurants. Unlimited
prize gaming machines (‘casino slots’) will be permitted only in casinos, and
nowhere else.

2.26

So the Government will look to the Gambling Commission to provide it with
guidance on the most prudent balance between the greater availability of
gambling opportunities and a rigorous protection of children and more
vulnerable members of society. In this way, the Commission will have a
wider role than a more traditional regulator – with responsibility to measure
the social impact of gambling as well as tending to its efficient regulation.

10

3.

A new approach to personal licensing

3.1

In line with the recommendations in the Gambling Review Report, “A safe bet
for success” confirmed that the Gambling Commission would issue licences
for specified persons involved with gambling operations.

3.2

The new regime will build on the present certificate of approval system
overseen by the Gaming Board. However, that system is based on the
personal licensing of very specific groups of employees, such as croupiers in
casinos, who are clearly identifiable. In preparing proposals for a new system
of personal licensing, the Government has been conscious of the diversity of
operations in different parts of the gambling industry. Attempting to license
named positions in all of these sectors could end up with an elaborate and
expensive system. It would also lead to confusion and uncertainty for
potential licence applicants and their employers. Additionally, putting such
licence categories in legislation would also run the risk of their becoming
obsolete in a relatively short time, as the industry evolved in response to new
opportunities. A more flexible regime for personal licensing is necessary.

Who will need a personal licence?
3.3

The published draft clauses focus on the functions performed by individuals
rather than the job title attached to a particular post. The clauses allow for
the Gambling Commission to specify the type of functions in an operating
licensee’s business that will need to be performed by the holder of a personal
licence. Indeed, the requirements relating to personal licensing will be
incorporated into conditions of the relevant operating licence.

3.4

The functions fall into two broad categories: management and operational.
Management functions will include particular legally defined roles – such as
directors and partners of a company. It will be for the Commission to decide
which directors or partners need to be licensed. They will also include roles
commonly filled by compliance officers and the managers or supervisors of
persons handling significant flows of money. An example of operational
functions will be posts where the individual has the ability to influence the
outcome of gambling.

3.5

The Commission will outline its approach to personal licensing in its
statement of licensing and regulation policy, but will be able to come to a
view about the appropriate level of personal licensing in each operation. In
reaching that view the Commission will need to ensure that level of personal
licensing in a particular organisation is appropriate to the risk involved.

3.6

It will be vital that the Commission has a sufficient understanding of each
business and operation that it is involved with so that it can properly identify
those roles that require personal licensing. This will call for consultation
before any final decisions are reached. It will be in the interests of the
Commission and those it is regulating to adopt a collaborative approach to
this process.

3.7

In some areas, most obviously where an individual is directly involved in the
outcome of the gambling event (for instance, croupiers who deal cards), the
requirement for personal licensing will be reasonably clear-cut. In other

11

circumstances the Commission may be required to make more finely judged
assessments.
Staff in betting offices
3.8

Perhaps the most obvious example of this (and this is an area where the
Government did not accept the recommendation of the Gambling Review
Body) is the level of personal regulation to be required in the betting
industry. The Government has already made it clear that it does not accept
that managers (or indeed, counter staff) of betting offices each require
personal licences. Staff in betting offices, part of a centrally controlled
network of outlets, often have little control over odds or products. In effect
they sell gambling products generated elsewhere. The service they provide
to customers can raise consumer protection issues, but in the wider scheme
of things they pose a lesser regulatory risk to the public. The expectation is
that such a risk as there is can be addressed by having personal licensing
introduced at a higher level in the organisation with a more senior manager
or supervisor effectively taking responsibility. As mentioned previously, such
decisions will be for the Commission to make in the light of the particular
circumstances that prevail.

3.9

Not all operating licensees will require there to be personal licences attached
to the gambling operation. Small operators, like racecourse bookmakers with
only one or two assistants, are unlikely to require personal licences. Small
operators exempt from personal licences will be defined in secondary
legislation, and the Commission will be able to advise the Government when
it believes that these categories require some amendment. It is anticipated,
however, that personal licences will be required to some degree in most
licensed gambling operations.

4.

Keeping standards high: enforcement, sanctions and offences

4.1

The work of the Gambling Commission will help ensure the gambling
industry’s reputation for excellence and integrity is preserved and enhanced,
with consumers in Great Britain and abroad. It will be the public body with
the primary responsibility to root out and take action against illegal
gambling. Its inspection staff (and those of local authorities) will have
statutory powers of entry, search and seizure when exercising their
enforcement functions.

Enforcement
4.2

The Commission will investigate alleged illegal gambling activities, whether
conducted by unlicensed parties or by licensed parties (i.e. those offering
gambling of a type not covered by their licences). It will initiate criminal
proceedings in connection with these, and other, gambling offences.

4.3

The Commission will also monitor and inspect licensed gambling operations.
It will review compliance with licence conditions and the law by operators
(for operating licences) and staff (for personal licences).

12

4.4

When the draft Bill is published in full, there will be provision for similar
powers to be exercised by local authorities in exercising their various
licensing functions under the Bill. There will also be comprehensive provision
made for appeals against all decisions, whether administrative or criminal.

Sanctions
4.5

Where licensees are believed to have committed offences, or are in breach of
their licence terms, the Commission will have a range of enforcement
powers. In addition to beginning criminal proceedings in relation to offences,
the Commission will also have available regulatory powers. Where an
operator has breached a licence condition or has otherwise committed an
offence and the Commission is satisfied that the facts are such that the
matter warrants the imposition of a sanction (having held appropriate
hearings), it may:
x Give the holder of the licence a formal warning;
x Vary the licence conditions or attach an additional condition to the
licence;
x Impose a financial penalty of any amount to be decided by the
Commission; and
x Revoke the licence.

4.6

The Bill contains appropriate safeguards on the exercise of the Commission’s
powers in this respect.

4.7

In pursuing its enforcement responsibilities the Commission will co-operate
and exchange information with law enforcement authorities, other regulators
(including the Financial Services Authority and the National Lottery
Commission), and overseas authorities in connection with areas of common
interest and the conduct of licensed operators and individuals. The Gaming
Board already undertakes such co-operation, and the Commission will take
this approach forward.

Inspection – powerful and independent
4.8

When the Government publishes the draft Bill in full, it will include detailed
proposals on the powers of Gambling Commission inspectors to monitor
compliance with licence conditions and to root out illegal gambling.
Commission inspectors will have more extensive, freestanding powers than
those exercised at present by inspectors of the Gaming Board, and the
powers will apply to a greater range of gambling activities.

Offences
4.9

So far as general offences are concerned, the draft Bill will make it an offence
to provide facilities for gambling without an authorisation under the Bill.
One such form of authorisation will be an appropriate operating or personal
licence issued by the Commission. This is intended to mean, for example,
that the holder of an operating licence, which is limited to the provision of
betting, will commit an offence if he operates a gaming business. There will
also be offences concerning provision of facilities at premises, for which there

13

is no premises licence or other authority under the Bill. Full details of the
offences will be contained in the full draft Bill to be published in the autumn.
4.10

So far as specific offences are concerned, one of the objectives of the draft
Bill encapsulated in the statutory licensing objectives is to ensure adequate
protection for vulnerable people and children from the effects of harmful
gambling. There will be a number of provisions designed to give this
intention real teeth. These include:

x Certain age related offences, which are required to ensure that persons
below certain age limits (usually eighteen years of age) do not partake in
gambling, and are not employed in the gambling activity; and
x Stricter controls over access by children to places where gambling takes
place.

5.

Next steps for reform

5.1

In the autumn, the Government will publish a complete draft Gambling Bill
for pre-legislative scrutiny that will comprehensively modernise the law on
gambling. The clauses published here are the result of extensive consultation
with interested bodies, and careful deliberation in Government. But they are
in draft form, and are not necessarily in the final form they will take when
the whole Bill is presented for scrutiny. Work will continue in the
Department on the remainder of the Bill. As that work continues, further
improvements will be made to clauses published here.

5.2

Alongside the matters addressed in the clauses published here, the complete
draft Gambling Bill will make provision for:

New rules on prize competitions.

14

5.3

At that time, we will also publish a further explanation of the policy
underpinning legislative proposals, as well as our assessment of regulatory
costs.

5.4

Over the coming months, the Department will continue its ongoing
discussions with the industry, the Gaming Board, other Government
Departments, the devolved administrations, local authorities, consumer
groups, charities concerned with problem gambling and all others with an
interest. These discussions have been invaluable in developing our policy
proposals and we will seek to be as inclusive as possible going forward.

5.5

Work on the remainder of our proposals is being tackled vigorously. We
publish this first package of draft clauses now to help develop the widest
possible understanding of what modernisation seeks to achieve, and to enlist
the help of interested parties to ensure that when we publish the complete
draft Bill, it achieves a comprehensive reform. At this stage, therefore, it
would probably be premature for those reading this to engage in a detailed
analysis or a critique of the clauses, and provide a comprehensive view to the
Department. Rather, it seems appropriate to publish now so that you can
engage in discussion on the principles and structure of our proposals as they
relate to the Gambling Commission and its functions. We welcome your
views on this.

5.6

The complete draft Bill, when published, is to be scrutinised by a joint
committee of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Pre-legislative
scrutiny by Parliament will build on the extensive consultations already
undertaken on the reform of gambling law. The Department looks forward to
this process, and hopes that it will serve as an important means to build
further support for the modernisation of gambling law that these proposals
represent.

GAMBLING BILL
——————————

EXPLANATORY NOTES

INTRODUCTION
1.
These explanatory notes relate to certain clauses of the draft Gambling Bill,
published by the Government on 15th July 2003 as part of the process of prelegislative scrutiny that will commence formally in the autumn. They have been
prepared by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in order to assist the reader
of these clauses and to help inform debate on them. These notes do not form part of
the Bill and have not been endorsed by Parliament.
2.
The notes need to be read in conjunction with the published clauses. They are
not, and are not meant to be, a comprehensive description of the clauses. So where a
clause or a part of a clause does not seem to require any explanation or comment,
none is given. Equally, as the clauses published on 15th July, to which these notes
relate, do not represent the whole Bill but merely certain parts of it, these notes
provide background information on clauses of the Bill yet to be published, where that
is appropriate.
3.
These explanatory notes do not provide any commentary on the compatibility
of the published clauses with the European Convention on Human Rights, since to do
so would be premature. Explanatory notes to accompany the publication of the full
draft Gambling Bill will address this issue.
4.
These explanatory notes do not address the financial effects of the draft Bill,
the effects of the draft Bill on public service manpower, or the regulatory appraisal for
the draft Bill. These matters will be addressed in the notes which accompany the draft
Bill when it is published in its entirety. A regulatory impact assessment has been
published separately, to accompany the draft clauses.

BACKGROUND
5.
The draft Gambling Bill will give effect to the Government’s proposals for the
reform of the law on gambling. The draft Bill will be published, in full, in the autumn
of 2003. At that time a scrutiny committee made up of members of the House of
Commons and the House of Lords will be convened to give formal, pre-legislative
consideration to the draft Bill.

48

6.
The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport is publishing the draft
clauses to which these notes relate in advance of publishing the full Bill. The policy
proposals were set out in the Government White Paper “A Safe Bet for Success”
(Cmnd 5397) published in March 2002. The White Paper was the Government’s
response to the report of the Gambling Review Body (Cmnd 5206) published in July
2001.
7.
The present legislation on gambling is contained, primarily, in three statutes:
the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963, the Gaming Act 1968 and the Lotteries
and Amusements Act 1976.

SUMMARY OF THE BILL
Overview of the proposals
8.
The draft Bill will produce a new regulatory regime for gambling in Great
Britain which is modern, flexible and comprehensive. The draft Bill will introduce,
for the first time, a unified regulator for gambling, the Gambling Commission (“the
Commission”). The Commission will have a remit for overseeing gambling
operations in Great Britain, but it will not regulate spread betting, which is currently
the preserve of the Financial Services Authority at least for the time being, or the
National Lottery, which is regulated by the National Lottery Commission.
9.
The draft Bill promotes better regulation in the gambling industry through the
introduction of a new scheme of licences and licence conditions (to be granted by the
Commission for gambling operators and gambling personnel, and by local authorities
for gambling premises). The draft Bill removes from licensing justices their existing
responsibility for granting certain betting and gaming permissions. Instead, the
Commission and local authorities will share between them responsibility for those
matters previously regulated by licensing justices.
10.
The Commission will take over the responsibilities of the Gaming Board for
Great Britain. The Commission will be responsible for granting operating and
personal licences for commercial gambling operators and staff working in the
industry. It will also regulate certain lottery promoters. It will issue codes of practice
and guidance to ensure best practice in the industry.
11.
Local authorities with have new powers to license gambling premises within
their area, as well as undertaking functions in relation to lower stake gaming machines
and clubs and miners’ welfare institutes. These matters will all form part of the draft
Bill when it is published in full.
12.
To ensure that gambling remains a safe, well-conducted and crime-free
activity in Great Britain, three licensing objectives will underpin the licensing
functions which the Commission and local authorities will perform. These objectives

49

are central to the new regulatory regime created by the draft Bill. They are:
x Preventing gambling from being a source of crime or disorder, being
associated with crime or disorder, or being used to support crime;
x Ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way; and
x Protecting children and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or
exploited by gambling.
13.
The draft Bill will also authorise certain types of social and domestic gambling
that can take place without need for express regulation by any regulatory authority.
14.
The draft Bill will provide appropriate rules for the lawful conduct of betting,
gaming and lotteries. This will be effected through provisions in the draft Bill itself,
regulations to be set out in secondary legislation, and matters which will be dealt with
through licence conditions, statutory guidance and codes of practice.
15.
The draft Bill accommodates the significant technological changes that have
taken place in the last 30 years by enabling gambling regulation to encompass the
provision of gambling where the player is not present on the premises. For example,
new provisions relating to remote gambling will allow operators based in Great
Britain to obtain licences that authorise the provision of gambling over the Internet.
The new licensing system has been designed to keep pace with future technological
developments, so that gambling delivered by any number of new remote means will
be capable of being subject to appropriate regulation.
16.
The draft Bill will repeal many provisions in the existing legislation which
fetter the consumer’s freedom to gamble. For example it will no longer be a
requirement that casinos can only be situated in certain “permitted” areas of Great
Britain; commercial bingo halls and casinos will no longer have to operate as clubs
with a 24 hour membership rule (making them places to which the public will now
have access), and bookmaking will now be able to take place on tracks on Good
Friday or Christmas day.
17.
The draft Bill will provide protection for children and vulnerable adults from
the effects of harmful gambling. It will do this through a number of targeted offences
that will prevent young persons from being given access to inappropriate or harmful
gambling opportunities. The Commission will promote socially responsible gambling
through licence conditions and codes of practice directed at those providing facilities
for gambling.
Summary of Published Clauses
18.
These explanatory notes only concern certain clauses of the draft Bill,

50

published in advance of the whole draft Bill. The matters covered in these clauses are:
x The creation of a new body, the Gambling Commission, its core functions and
powers (Part 2 and Schedules 1 and 2);
x The licensing objectives and certain key definitions (Part 1);
x The licensing regime for gambling operations, administered by the Gambling

Commission (Part 3); and
x The licensing regime for personnel undertaking specified functions in a

gambling operation, also administered by the Gambling Commission (Part 4).
19.

The published clauses will have effect in England, Wales and Scotland.

Summary of Draft Bill
20.
The full draft Bill will cover a wide range of matters which are required to

21.

This list is not exhaustive or reflective of the order that the draft Bill will take

51

when published in full. It does cover the major subject areas for the draft Bill.
22.
The draft Bill will provide necessary definitions, and there will be transitional
provisions for transfer from the existing regulatory system to the new regime under
the Bill. The draft Bill will provide for consequential amendments to be made to
other legislation and will also cover the repeals necessary to effect the new regulatory
regime.

COMMENTARY ON CLAUSES
Part 1
Introduction
23.
Part 1 of the draft Bill will set out the key definitions for the Bill, and certain
key concepts. The published clauses cover three such definitions together with the
licensing objectives.
Clause 1: The licensing objectives
24.
The published clauses set out licensing functions to be exercised by the
Commission in relation to operating and personal licences, and will set out the
functions to be performed by local authorities undertaking the licensing of premises.
In exercising these functions, regard must be had by the Commission and local
authorities respectively to the licensing objectives. These are:
x Preventing gambling from being a source of crime or disorder, being

associated with crime or disorder or being used to support crime;
x Ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way; and
x Protecting children and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or

exploited by gambling.
25.

Clause 6 describes the Commission’s duty to promote the licensing objectives.

Clause 2: Facilities for gambling
26.
There are a number of ways in which individuals and organisations can offer
or partake in gambling activities, whether commercially or in a domestic setting.
Clause 2 provides a key definition by describing the types of conduct which, for the
purposes of the draft Bill, will amount to the provision of facilities for gambling. This
is a key definition because the scheme of regulation and licensing that the draft Bill
will provide is primarily directed to persons who provide facilities for gambling. As a
result some of the offences that the Bill will contain will be addressed to persons
providing facilities for gambling.
27.

Under subsections (1) and (2) a person will be taken to provide facilities for

52

gambling where he:
a) Invites others to gamble in accordance with arrangements made by
him;
b) Provides, operates or administers arrangements for gambling by
others,
c) Participates in the operation or administration of gambling by others;
or
d) Knowingly facilitates gambling in accordance with arrangements
made with a person who undertakes or intends to undertake (a), (b) or
(c).
28.
However, there are circumstances where a person may be providing facilities
for gambling within the meaning of this clause, but where their conduct does not
require regulation under the Bill. Therefore, subsection (3) provides a number of
circumstances where a person will not be deemed to be providing facilities for
gambling. These are intended to cover:
x The supply of goods (other than a gaming machine) to a person who intends to

use them to provide facilities for gambling (subsection (3) paragraph (a)) e.g.
the supplier of a roulette wheel to a casino;
x The supply of goods (other than a gaming machine) to a person who may use
them for gambling, but does not intend to use them to provide facilities for
gambling (subsection (3) paragraph (b)) e.g. a retailer supplying a pack of
playing cards to a person for domestic use;
x The provision of services to persons providing facilities for gambling where
the services themselves have nothing to do with the provision of gambling
facilities (subsection (3) paragraph (c)) e.g. an accountant providing
professional services to a betting business; and
x Electronic communications providers who do nothing more than act as a

carrier of information for persons providing facilities for gambling or
consumers partaking in gambling e.g. an internet service provider or mobile
telephone operator (subsection (3) paragraph (d)).
Clause 3: Remote gambling
29.
One of the key aims of the draft Bill is to regulate effectively the various
technological means by which gambling activities can now be conducted. The Bill
uses the concept of “remote gambling” to cover gambling which is not premises
based, i.e. where all the people partaking in the gambling are not in the same place.
30.
Clause 3 defines “remote gambling” by referring to the types of remote
communication by which the gambling is being conducted. These are:

53

a)
b)
c)
d)
e)

The Internet;
Telephone;
Television;
Radio; or
Any other kind of electronic or other technology for facilitating
communication.

31.
This list is broad enough to encompass modern means of communication such
as interactive television and mobile telephony, and ensures that the definition can
keep pace with future developments in this field. However, in order to provide
certainty as well as flexibility for the industry, the Commission and the courts, the
Secretary of State may specify in regulations that a specified system or method of
communication is or is not to be treated as a form of remote communication for the
purpose of the definition.
32.
Part 3 of the draft Bill, on operating licences, when it is in its final form, will
provide for operating licences which authorise remote gambling.

PART 2: THE GAMBLING COMMISSION
Clause 4: Establishment of the Commission
33.
This clause establishes a new Gambling Commission which will be the
central regulatory body for gambling in Great Britain. Schedule 1, discussed below,
provides for the detailed constitution of the Commission and its proceedings, the
appointment of Commissioners and staff, and its financial and reporting
arrangements.
34.
The Commission will take over the responsibilities of the Gaming Board for
Great Britain, which currently regulates gaming and certain forms of lotteries (see
clause 5).
35.
Parts 3 and 4 of the draft Bill provide for two new licensing regimes to be
operated by the Commission. Under these licensing regimes the Commission will
assume responsibility for:
a) the licensing of bookmakers currently undertaken by licensing justices
(and local licensing boards in Scotland);
b) the licensing of commercial gaming operators e.g. casino operators;
c) the licensing of pools promoters;
d) the licensing of certain lottery operators and managers;
e) the licensing of gaming machine manufacturers and suppliers; and
f) the licensing of operators providing remote gambling.

54

36.

Details of all these matters will be contained in the full draft Bill.

SCHEDULE 1: THE GAMBLING COMMISSION
Paragraphs 1 to 3: Constitution and tenure
37.
The Gambling Commission will consist of a chairman and other
commissioners. The Secretary of State will appoint all of these. The Secretary of State
will have power to dismiss a commissioner whom she believes to be unable, unfit or
unwilling to perform his functions, and a commissioner may resign his appointment.
Paragraphs 4-5: Staff
38.
The Commission may appoint a chief executive of the Commission if it
wishes, and the chief executive may also hold a position as a commissioner. No
approval from the Secretary of State is required for the appointment of a chief
executive. The Commission may also appoint other staff with the approval of the
Secretary of State as to their terms and conditions of employment.
Paragraphs 6-7: Proceedings
39.
The Commission may determine its own proceedings, and is to publish details
of the arrangements it makes. In so doing, the Commission may delegate a function
under the draft Bill to: a commissioner, a commissioners’ committee, or an employee
of the Commission. Such delegation may include any discretionary function, a review
function (for which see clause 33 (Review)) or the exercise of a regulatory power (see
clause 34 (Regulatory powers)).
Paragraphs 8-11: Money
40.
Paragraph 8 authorises the Commission to make payments by way of
remuneration, allowances, expenses, pensions and gratuities to commissioners and
Commission staff. Paragraphs 9 to 11 describe the accounting requirements for the
Commission, which include a requirement for the Commission’s annual statement of
accounts to be examined, and reported on to Parliament, by the Comptroller and
Auditor General. Clauses concerning the funding of the Commission will be
contained in the full draft Bill.
Paragraph 12: Annual report
41.
This paragraph provides that after the end of each financial year the
Commission will send a report of its year’s activities to the Secretary of State. The
Secretary of State will lay a copy before Parliament and may publish the report.
Clause 5: Gaming Board: transfer to Commission
42.
The functions, rights and liabilities, which include the property, of the Gaming
Board for Great Britain (established pursuant to section 10 of the Gaming Act 1968)
are to be transferred to the Gambling Commission on a date to be decided (the
commencement date). Schedule 2, described below, sets out detailed provisions to
effect the transfer once the provision is commenced. At the point of transfer, the

55

chairman and the commissioners of the Gaming Board will become the first chairman
and commissioners of the Gambling Commission.

SCHEDULE 2: TRANSFER FROM GAMING BOARD TO GAMBLING
COMMISSION: SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION
43.
Paragraphs 1 to 5 of Schedule 2 make a number of technical provisions to
achieve the smooth and certain transfer from the Gaming Board to the Commission. It
allows the Commission to step into the shoes of the Board, without prejudicing any
action, decision or pending proceeding of the Board. Upon commencement,
references to the Board in any legislation or document will be construed as a reference
to the Commission.
Clause 6: Duty to promote the licensing objectives
44.
In carrying out its functions under the Act, the Commission will have the
statutory aim of pursuing, and wherever appropriate having regard to, the licensing
objectives (as set out at clause 1) and permitting gambling in so far as it thinks such
permission is reasonably consistent with pursuit of the licensing objectives. Therefore,
in carrying out its licensing functions under Parts 3 and 4 of the draft Bill or in issuing
guidance and codes of practice or advising the Secretary of State in accordance with
Part 2, the Commission will have regard to this statutory aim.
Clause 7: Policy for licensing and regulation
45.
The Commission will be responsible for licensing gambling operators and
personnel working in the gambling industry under the provisions of Part 3 (operating
licences) and Part 4 (personal licences) of the draft Bill. This will be the primary
licensing activity of the Commission, although the Bill will also provide it with other
regulatory and advisory functions concerned with the proper conduct and control of
gambling in Great Britain. The Commission will have enforcement and prosecution
powers.
46.
Clause 7 requires the Gambling Commission to prepare, publish, and keep
under review, a statement which sets out the principles which will govern the exercise
of its functions, and, in particular, explain how such principles will assist the
Commission in its pursuit of the licensing objectives. This statement will underpin
the work of the Commission. Examples of specific matters which will be contained in
the statement are:
a) The principles, practice and procedure which the Commission will
apply in considering applications for operating and personal licences
(see clause 15 (Consideration of application: general principles) and
clause 46 (Application of provisions of Part 3) and the accompanying
explanatory notes);
b) The general conditions which the Commission will impose on all

56

operating or personal licences; or on specified classes of operating or
personal licence (see clause 19 (General conditions imposed by
Commission) and clause 46 (Application of provisions of Part 3) and
the accompanying explanatory notes); and
c) The determination of the periods for which operating licences, or
classes of operating licences, will be granted, within the maximum tenyear duration (see clause 37 (Initial duration) and the accompanying
explanatory note).
47.
The Commission will prepare a separate policy statement on its use of
financial penalties in its enforcement role, for which see clause 36(6) (Financial
penalty).
48.
Before issuing or revising a statement, clause 7(5) provides that the
Commission must consult the following:
x The Secretary of State;
x Representatives of local authorities;
x Representatives of police forces;
x Representatives of gambling businesses;
x Persons with knowledge of social problems that may be associated with

gambling; and
x As appropriate, members of the public.

49.

The Statement may be published in parts, and any revisions shall be published.

Clause 8: Codes of practice
50.
As part of the Commission’s regulatory oversight of gambling it may publish
codes of practice about the manner in which facilities for gambling are provided,
which are directed at the holders of operating or personal licences, or any other
person. Clause 8 makes provision to this effect.
51.
The Commission will publish its codes of practice, and all revisions, in a
manner that will ensure those to whom it is addressed are made aware of them, and
the codes are required to state clearly when they, or any revisions to them, come into
force.
52.
By virtue of clause 22(2) (Scope of power to attach conditions) codes of
practice can have relevance to the conditions which the Commission attaches to

57

licences pursuant to clauses 19 (General conditions imposed by the Commission), 20
(Individual conditions imposed by the Commission) and 21 (Condition imposed by
Secretary of State). Thus, any of these three types of condition may operate wholly or
partly by reference to compliance with a code of practice.
53.
A failure to comply with a code will not, of itself, render a person liable to
prosecution or a civil action. However, the codes will be admissible in evidence for
criminal or civil proceedings; are to be taken into account by a court or tribunal in any
case where it appears to be relevant; and are to be taken into account by the
Commission in exercising any of its functions. For example, where a licence holder
has his operating licence reviewed by the Gambling Commission for potential breach
of a licence condition, pursuant to clause 33 (Review), the Commission will refer to a
code of practice, where it is relevant.
54.
Before issuing or revising a code of practice, subsection (7) provides that the
Gambling Commission must consult:
x The Secretary of State; and
x People with knowledge of social problems that may be associated with

gambling.
55.
Depending on the nature of code or any revision, subsection (8) provides that
the Commission shall also consult:
x Representatives of local authorities;
x Representatives of police forces;
x Representatives of gambling businesses; and
x Members of the public (in such manner as the Commission thinks fit),

where the Commission thinks it appropriate to do so.
Clause 9: Guidance to local authorities
56.
Under the draft Bill, local authorities will undertake licensing functions in
relation to a number of gambling activities. They will be responsible for the licensing
of premises for gaming and betting; they will regulate members’ clubs and miners’
welfare institutes who wish to undertake certain gaming activities; they will grant
permission for certain lower stake gaming machines; and they will register societies’
lotteries below certain prescribed thresholds. Subsequent clauses of the draft Bill, to
be published, will set out all of these matters in full, with accompanying explanatory
notes.

58

57.
In order to assist local authorities to perform these various regulatory and
licensing functions, clause 9 enables the Gambling Commission to issue and publish
guidance about:
x The manner in which local authorities are to exercise their functions under the
Bill; and
x In particular, the principles to be applied by local authorities in exercising
functions under the Bill.
58.
Local authorities are placed under a duty, by subsection (2), to have regard to
such guidance.
59.
Before issuing guidance to local authorities, subsection (4) provides that the
Gambling Commission shall consult:
x The Secretary of State;
x Representatives of local authorities; and
x Persons with knowledge of social problems that may be associated with
gambling.
60.
Depending on the nature of the code or any revision, subsection (5) provides
that the Commission shall also consult:
x Representatives of police forces;
x Representatives of gambling businesses; and
x Members of the public (in such manner as the Commission thinks fit),

where the Commission thinks it appropriate to do so.
Clause 10: Duty to Advise Secretary of State
61.
One of the functions of the Gambling Commission will be to provide advice to
the Secretary of State on the regulation and control of gambling. Accordingly, this
clause provides for the Gambling Commission to make recommendations about
gambling (about its incidence, the manner in which it is carried on, the effects of
gambling and its regulation) to the Secretary of State either in response to a request
from the Secretary of State or on its own initiative.

59

PART 3 – OPERATING LICENCES
62.
Part 3 of the draft clauses describes the new regime of licences for the
operation of gambling to be administered by the Commission. Operating licences will
be the main form of permission for the operation of commercial gambling. They will
also be required for certain limited forms of non-commercial gambling.
63.
Operating licences will be required for the operation of gambling which takes
place both on premises and remotely (e.g. on the Internet or via television – see clause
3), as well as for other forms of gambling which are neither premises based nor
remote (e.g. operating certain types of lotteries). Licences will also be required in
relation to the manufacture, sale and maintenance of certain forms of equipment used
for gambling. This part of this package of draft clauses does not set out the detail of
the different types of gambling activities that will require an operating licence. This
will be set out in full in the complete draft Bill.
64.
An applicant for an operating licence can be an individual, a business or an
association of persons. To obtain an operating licence the applicant and its business
will be required to undergo a rigorous process of scrutiny conducted by the
Commission. In addition to rules deriving from the legislation, licensees will be
regulated through various types of licence conditions that may be attached to the
licence by the Commission, or by the Secretary of State through regulations.
Clause 11: Exception to offence of prohibited gambling
65.
When the complete draft Bill is published, it will contain a clause concerning
the general offences relating to gambling, referred to here as clause j500. It will be an
offence for any person to provide facilities for gambling as defined in clause 2, unless
authorised under the Bill. Operating licences are one such authorisation, and any legal
person may provide facilities for gambling legally where they hold an operating
licence for the relevant type of gambling, or where they provide the facilities in the
service of another person who holds such a licence. In each case, licence holders and
those working for them will avoid committing the offence as long as the facilities
have been provided in accordance with any licence conditions.
Clause 12: Nature of licence
66.
This clause is the basis for the operating licence system, and enables the
Commission to issue operating licences for the provision of facilities for gambling.
The clause makes reference to clauses j581 - 606 which are absent in this draft but
will be included in the complete draft Bill. These clauses will outline the different
classes of gambling activity which will be licensable under clause 12. Broadly, these
will cover casinos, bingo, betting, certain lotteries, certain gaming machine facilities,
and the manufacture, supply, maintenance and repair of gaming machines. However,
within these broad activities there will be various subcategories of activity, such as
e.g. betting intermediaries. Providers of facilities for gambling will be exempt from
the requirement to hold a licence in certain circumstances, e.g. social domestic
gambling. These exemptions will be set out in full in the complete draft Bill. There

60

will be no limit on the number of licences that the Commission may issue for each of
these activities, and it may grant a licence covering some or all of these activities to a
single applicant.
67.
Subsection (3) refers to clause j552 which will be included in the complete
draft Bill. The effect of subsection (3) is that where an operating licence specifies that
the holder may carry out his business on premises, he will still require a separate
premises licence issued by the local authority, in order to carry out his business
lawfully. The clauses relating to premises licences will be included in the complete
draft Bill.
Clause 13: Form of licence
68.
Subsection (1) provides for certain information which must be specified on the
operating licence, including any general or individual condition attached to the licence
by the Commission (see the notes on clauses 19 – 20). It will not however be
necessary for any conditions set by the Secretary of State by statutory instrument to be
specified on the licence (see the notes on clause 21). Under subsection (2) the licence
must state the classes of activity it authorises, which may be more than one.
69.
Subsection (3) provides that the licence must state whether it is for gambling
conducted by remote means, such as television or the Internet (see clause 3).
Subsection (4) provides that it is necessary to have separate operating licences for
remote and non-remote activities. It is, however, intended that the licensing of
gambling by remote technology will be further developed in the complete draft Bill.
70.
The form of the licence is not prescribed under the Bill. Instead, subsection (5)
gives the Secretary of State a power to make regulations specifying the form in which
licences are to be issued and additional information the licence must specify.
Clauses 14-18: Applications for operating licences
71.
Clause 14 gives the procedure for applying to the Commission for an
operating licence, and states the matters which must be specified in the application.
Rather than have forms prescribed in legislation, the Commission will have flexibility
to specify the form of applications. Applications will be required to contain the
information set out in subsection (2) and be accompanied by the correct fee. Fees will
be set by the Secretary of State in regulations under subsection (5) and may vary
according to the type of activity and the size of the proposed activity.
72.
In particular, subsection (2) provides that applicants will be required to give
information concerning any criminal offence for which they have been convicted. The
Commission will be able to consider these convictions when assessing the applicant’s
suitability to hold an operating licence. In the current draft, a distinction is drawn
between ‘relevant’ offences, which will be those that are thought sufficiently serious
and significant, and other criminal offences. It is envisaged that the Commission will
be required to place a different emphasis on these offences in their decision making,
and that different provisions will apply in relation to whether the convictions are

61

‘spent’ under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (see clause 43 – relevant
offence - disapplication of rehabilitation). This formulation, and the detail as to the
offences falling within the category of ‘relevant offences’, will be set out in full in the
complete draft Bill.
73.
Subsection (3) sets a minimum age limit of 18 for an individual to make an
application. This provision also prevents an applicant which is a group from making
an application where any individual in the group is under 18.
74.
Subsection (4) gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations
requiring applicants to notify specified persons of their application. The Secretary of
State may consider it necessary to oblige applicants to notify bodies such as the police
or Customs and Excise of the application, who may wish to advise the Commission
about the suitability of the applicants. Even without this power being used, the
Commission will still be able to take into account the opinion of others. Regulations
will also be able to specify the consequences of failure to comply.
75.
Clause 15 provides for the general principles directing the Commission’s
decision making in relation to operating licence applications. In considering whether
or not to grant an application, the Commission must have regard to the licensing
objectives. It must also have regard to its opinion of the suitability of the applicant to
carry out the activities it wishes to be licensed to conduct. The latter part of this test
draws upon the ‘fit and proper’ test for certificates of approval under the Gaming Act
1968. Subsection (2) sets out the factors which can be taken into account when
assessing suitability: integrity, competence to carry out the licensed activities
consistently with the licensing objectives, and financial and other circumstances.
These factors can relate to either the applicant, or another person relevant to the
application.
76.
Subsection (3) requires the Commission to specify in the statement issued
under clause 7 the principles which it will apply when considering applications. Under
subsection (4) the statement is to include the kind of evidence to which the
Commission is to have regard when assessing integrity and competence. The
evidence may include interviews, references, information or opinions from others,
training and qualifications. The Commission may consult any other person or
organisation it wishes. It may, for example, wish to consult a foreign police force in a
country where an applicant has some presence. The assessment of suitability will
therefore focus not just on integrity, but also on the very practical aspects of
delivering the gambling. So, for example, a betting operator may be invited to explain
how he intends to ensure that debts are settled and from what source he is able to get
pre-race data.
77.
Clause 16 allows the Commission to refuse an application if the applicant or a
person relevant to the application has criminal convictions for certain criminal
offences. The ‘relevant offences’ are distinguished here for the purposes of the

62

application of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.
78.
Clause 17 sets out the information the Commission may require the applicant
to provide in order to consider his application. It also allows the Commission a wide
power to consult and to have regard to information or opinions in its decision-making.
In particular, subsection (3) allows the Commission to require an enhanced criminal
record certificate under section 115 of the Police Act 1997 in relation to either the
applicant or a person relevant to the application. Such a certificate will state all
criminal convictions including those that are ‘spent’ and also may include additional
information from local police force records; the Police National Computer and
government department lists where appropriate. Subsections (4) and (5) oblige the
Commission to specify in the clause 7 statement the practice and procedure for their
decision making in relation to applications. Subsection (6) gives the Commission
discretion to disregard imperfections in the drafting of applications, apart from where
the application fee has not been paid. This means that where there is a minor error in
the application, the Commission is not obliged to reject it automatically.
79.
Under clause 18, following consideration, the Commission may grant or refuse
applications in full or in part. Where it approves applications, it is to issue the licence
and notify the applicant as soon as reasonably practicable. Where it refuses an
application, in whole or in part, it should notify the applicant and explain the reasons
for refusal. The draft Bill, when published in full, will make provision for an appeal
mechanism that can be employed by applicants who have had their application (or a
part of it) refused.
Clauses 19-22: Licence conditions
80.
In the current legislation, detailed rules are prescribed in primary and
secondary legislation as to how licensees may conduct their businesses. One of the
new features of regulation proposed by the draft Bill are the powers of the
Commission directly to regulate the licensed operators by imposing conditions on
operating licences. There will be two types of Commission condition: general
conditions and individual conditions, under clauses 19 and 20 respectively. Under
clause 21, the Secretary of State will also be able to impose conditions on licences
through regulations.
81.
Clause 19 gives the Commission a power to impose general conditions on
operating licences. The Commission will use its general statement of licensing policy
issued under clause 7 to specify what these general conditions will be. A prospective
operator, therefore, will be able to consult the licensing policy when considering
whether to make an application. General conditions can be attached either to all
operating licences, or a certain class of operating licences, delineated by various
factors, e.g. the nature of the licensed activities. So, for example, if the Commission
grants a licence to a casino operator, it will have to place on each casino operating
licence all the conditions which apply generally to all casino operators, as described in
its clause 7 licensing policy statement.

63

82.
Subsection (4) sets out the procedure to be followed where the Commission
wishes to revise the conditions described in its licensing policy. It might, for example,
want to prohibit a new form of gaming in casinos whose rules it believes are
insufficiently transparent. It will first be required consult persons who represent
relevant licensees. Following consultation, a change to the licensing policy must be
notified to relevant licence holders no less than three months before is to come into
effect. If the Commission issues a relevant licence during the period of notice, it must
ensure that the new licensee is made aware of the change intended. Where a change
comes into effect it applies to all relevant licences immediately. There is also power
for the Commission to make more urgent changes to licence conditions, with a shorter
period of notice than three months.
83.
Under clause 20, the Commission will also have power to impose conditions
on individual operating licenses. Hypothetically, it may take the view that a particular
applicant for an operating licence to provide betting office facilities does not have the
necessary competence or financial support to offer gambling in more than a certain
number of premises, and may impose a condition on an individual operating licence
restricting the number of betting offices permitted under the licence to fifty. The
applicant will, however, have the right of appeal against this. This will be provided for
in full in the complete draft Bill.
84.
In addition to the above, all three types of condition may do the things set out
in clause 22. In particular, subsection (2) enables the Commission or the Secretary of
State to set a condition requiring compliance with a code of practice. So, for example,
operators of internet gambling may be required to comply with a provision of a code
of practice describing ways in which they should offer users the ability to ‘selfexclude’ themselves from further activity on the website. Subsection (4) provides that
conditions may restrict the licensed activities to a particular type of activity or class of
licence.
Clause 23 - 24: Requirement for personal licence
85.
In a gambling operation, in addition to the operating licence holder, the
Commission will also require certain persons involved in the provision of facilities for
gambling to hold a personal licence. These personal licences will be similar to the
certificates of approval currently issued by the Gaming Board under section 19 and
Schedule 5 to the Gaming Act 1968. The Commission, in conditions attached to the
operating licence, will set the requirement for a licensed operator to have certain posts
filled by a personal licence holder. The Commission will attach either a general or an
individual licence condition to each operating licence, making it a requirement that
there is at least one person in a gambling operation who occupies a ‘specified
management office’ and holds a personal licence under Part 4 authorising their
functions under the office.
86.
Under subsection (3) a condition may dictate that where such an office is held,
it must be by a person holding a personal licence and they must pursue the functions
of their office in accordance with the conditions of the personal licence. Management

64

offices can include directors and partners, and officers in an unincorporated
association or a post that involves a supervisory role in relation to gambling activities.
87.
Under subsection (4), it may be specified by condition that if certain
‘operational functions’ are to be performed in relation to the licensed activity, they
must be performed by a personal licence holder in accordance with the personal
licence. Operational functions may include any function that enables the person to
influence the outcome of gambling, the receiving of stakes and payment of winnings,
and activities in relation to making gaming machines available. The Secretary of State
will have a power to amend these definitions through secondary legislation.
88.
Clause 24 provides that certain small-scale operators will be exempt from the
requirement to have a person with a personal licence occupying a specified
management office. The Secretary of State will be able to define the meaning of
‘small scale operator’ in particular by reference to the size and value of the business,
and the number of employees. Subsection (4) requires that where the operator is
carrying on a licensed activity, they may be required by a police constable or a
Commission inspector to produce their licence immediately, in contrast to other
operating licence holders, who are only required to produce theirs within a specified
period. This is because where a licensed operator is not a small scale operator, it will
be obliged to have a personal licence holder in a specified management office who
will be obliged to produce the licence on demand in these circumstances.
Clause 25: Annual fee
89.
By virtue of this clause, each operating licence holder is obliged to pay an
annual fee to the Commission following the grant of the licence. The Secretary of
State will have a power to set, by regulations, different fees in respect of different
classes of activity or circumstances. Subsection (5) gives an exemption from the
requirement to pay the annual fee where the licence falls due immediately prior to its
ceasing to have effect. Under clause 35(3) failure to pay the annual fee will result in
the licence being revoked.
Clause 26: Change of circumstances
90.
This clause provides the Secretary of State with a power to make regulations
requiring operating licence holders to notify the Commission of changes of
circumstance to be prescribed in the regulations. Hypothetically, regulations could
prescribe that notification would be required if the applicant’s principal financial
backer changed during the period of the operating licence. Failure to notify the
Commission of any such changes would be an additional offence. Subsection (5)
makes it clear that the Commission may also set requirements under their condition
making powers for operators to notify the Commission of other changes not included
in regulations.
Clause 27: Application to vary licence
91.
This clause gives provisions relating to the variation procedure for operating
licences. The licence holder will have the right to apply to the Commission to have its

65

licence varied if, for example, it wishes to make adjustments in the gambling activities
possible under the licence without going through the procedures involved in making a
new application. The licence holder can apply to the Commission to add, remove or
change an individual condition or an authorised activity on the licence, or to amend
any other detail of the licence.
92.
Subsection (2) makes it clear that this clause does not enable the use of the
variation procedure to transfer the licence to another licence holder. When the
complete Bill is published, it is intended that it will contain a mechanism, however,
enabling the Commission to approve a change of control of a licence holder where it
is a company limited by shares.
Clause 28: Amendment
93.
Clause 28 enables the Commission to require the licence holder to send them
the physical licence, so that they can make amendments to it where changes have been
made to the licence following procedures under this part. The licensee will have 14
days to comply with a requirement to submit the physical licence for amendment, and
will commit an offence if he does not submit it. Subsection (5) makes it clear that the
changes to the Commission’s general conditions as a result of these procedures will
nevertheless have automatic effect, whether or not the physical licence itself is
amended.
Clause 29: Register of operating licences
94.
Clause 29 obliges the Commission to maintain a register of operating licences,
which it must allow the public to have access to, and must provide copies of entries to
the public on request. The Commission will be able to charge a reasonable fee for
these services. The Commission will have a discretion as to the information the
register is to contain.
Clause 30: Copy of licence
95.
Clause 30 enables the Commission to make arrangements to provide duplicate
copies of operating licences, to be treated as though they were the original licence, in
circumstances where the original has been lost, stolen or damaged. This includes
circumstances where the original has been damaged to the extent that it has been
totally destroyed. The Commission may charge a fee, set in regulations made by the
Secretary of State, and may insist that the licence holder reports any loss or theft to
the police.
Clause 31: Production of licence
96.
Clause 31 provides for the right of a police constable or a Commission
inspector to require a licence holder to produce his licence, within a specified period
of time. This means that the licence holder is not obliged to carry his licence on his
person at all times, as long as he is able to produce it within a given time period,
unless he is a small scale operator as defined in clause 24 above. If he fails to produce
the licence within the specified period without reasonable excuse, however, this is to
be an offence. Production of the licence will enable the constable or inspector to

66

check whether the licensee is acting in accordance with his licence and its conditions.
The status and powers of Commission inspectors will be established further in the
complete draft Bill.
Clause 32: Conviction
97.
Clause 32 obliges the licence holder to notify the Commission where he is
convicted of criminal offences, and on conviction for certain offences, to notify the
court that he holds an operating licence. This is to ensure that the Commission is kept
aware of all information regarding the suitability of the person to conduct gambling,
and the court is aware of the existence of the licence in order that it is able to use its
power to forfeit the licence under clause 40 where appropriate. The specific details as
to the offences we are concerned with here will be set out in full in the complete draft
Bill.
Clause 33: Review
98.
Under clause 33, the Commission has a vital power to review operating
licences. Subsection (1) gives a power of review over operating licences of a
particular class in respect of the licence holders’ conduct of the licensed activities, and
their compliance with the licence conditions. This is a power rather than a duty, so if
the Commission does not think that a particular class of licence requires a review, it
need not conduct one.
99.
Subsection (2) gives the Commission a power of review over particular
operating licences in certain circumstances, where, for example, it believes that the
licence holder is carrying on the activity in breach of a licence condition, or has been
convicted of a criminal offence. Where the Commission wishes to review an
individual licence, subsection (3) obliges the Commission to give the licence holder
notice, to inform him of the procedure for the review. Subsection (4) requires the
Commission to give the licence holder and other persons an opportunity to make
representations concerning the review.
Clauses 34 – 35: Commission’s powers on review
100. Clause 34 provides the regulatory powers which the Commission may exercise
following a review under clause 33 (1). It may issue a warning to the licence holder,
add or change the condition of the licence, revoke the licence or impose a financial
penalty. Any action under this power must be notified to the licensee as soon as
possible, along with reasons.
101. The power to review licences need not only be a punitive process.
Hypothetically, the Commission may have issued a class of licence and restricted by
general condition the range of gambling products that licensees were permitted to
offer. Subsequently however, it may conduct a review of the class of licence and
decide to revise conditions under clause 19.
102. Following a review under clause 33 (1), clause 35 gives the Commission
power to revoke an operating licence in certain circumstances, namely where the

67

licensed activity has been conducted inconsistently with the licensing objectives;
breach of a licence condition; failure to notify the Commission of a change in
circumstances, to cooperate with a review, or to submit the physical licence to the
Commission for amendment; or where the licence holder has become unsuitable.
Subsection (3) gives the Commission the right to revoke the licence for non payment
of the annual fee, although this is not mandatory in circumstances where the
Commission believes it is as a result of an administrative error.
103. Clause 36 gives the Commission power to impose a financial penalty on the
licence holder as a regulatory sanction for breach of a licence condition. Under
subsection (2), the Commission is obliged to notify the licence holder before imposing
such a penalty, alerting him to the amount of the penalty and reasons for it, and
inviting him to make representations. Subsection (3) imposes a limitation period on
the Commission’s right to take action to impose such a penalty. Under subsection (4),
the Commission will only be able to issue a notice imposing a requirement to pay the
penalty, once the period in which the licence holder may make representations has
expired. Subsection (5) enables the Commission to enforce the penalty in the manner
of any other civil debt. Subsection (6) requires the Commission to publish a statement
of principle setting out how its powers under this clause will be carried out. This is
separate from the clause 7 statement. There is to be no limit to the level of fine
allowed, but in setting a penalty, the Commission will have to have regard to certain
factors including the seriousness of the breach, and the state of knowledge of the
licence holder at the time of the offence.
Clause 37: Initial duration
104. The Commission will be given the power to set the length of operating
licences up to a maximum duration of ten years. The Commission may specify
different periods for operating licences catering for different classes of gambling
activity. However, the Commission may not set different lengths for individual
licence holders, so that, for example, if two people hold an operating licence entitling
them to run a bingo operation, the length of both licences must be the same. As part of
the statement, which the Commission is to publish under clause 7, it will publish its
policy on the duration of operating licences. The duration of licences may be altered
by the Commission, but only as far as this affects licences after the date of the
alteration. The Secretary of State will be able to override the Commission’s power,
having a reserve power to fix the durations for operating licences or particular
categories of operating licence, and will be able to amend the ten year maximum
duration. The Regulations may not be retrospective.
Clause 38 - 39: Surrender and lapse
105. If the holder of an operating licence no longer wishes to retain the licence, for
example because he has ceased running his business, or is proposing to sell his
business, he may give it up voluntarily by surrendering it to the Commission under the
provisions of clause 38. He may not transfer the licence.
106.

Clause 39 provides for the operating licence to lapse where the licence holder

68

is no longer able to conduct gambling. This can be for various reasons. Where the
licence holder is an individual, the licence will lapse if the licensee dies, becomes
incapable as a consequence of mental or physical incapacity, or becomes bankrupt.
Where the licence holder is a company or other association, this clause also provides
for lapse where the licence holder ceases to exist or becomes insolvent.
Clause 40: Forfeiture
107. Clause 40 gives a power to a court to forfeit an operating licence where the
licence holder is convicted of certain, more serious and significant criminal offences.
These offences will be specified in full in the complete draft Bill. Such action may be
taken directly by the convicting court, an appeal court, or the High Court where
relevant. The court may also suspend the licence. Where the court forfeits the licence,
it must notify the Commission of its decision and the licensee must deliver the licence
to the Commission, or explain why it cannot be provided.
Clause 41: Renewal of licence
108. Licensees will be able to apply for renewal during the period between three
months and one month before the licence is due to expire. Where the Commission is
still considering an application for renewal on the date when the licence is due to
expire, then the licence will still have effect until the application is determined.
109. The procedures for making an application for renewal may be the same as
those for the original application, but, equally, different arrangements may also be
made. The application for renewal must, however, be accompanied by the licence or a
statement must be provided explaining why it is not possible to do so.
Clause 43: Relevant offence: disapplication of rehabilitation
110. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 allows for criminal convictions to
become ‘spent’ after a period of time following conviction and the payment of any
fine or the serving of any period of imprisonment. It is intended that where the
criminal convictions of a licence holder or a person relevant to the application may be
taken into account by the Commission, certain convictions of a certain type will be
able to be taken into account even if the conviction is ‘spent’. These offences will be
set out in full in the complete draft Bill.

PART 4: PERSONAL LICENCES
111. This part of the Bill deals with the personal licences that certain individuals
working in the gambling industry will be required to obtain. Personal licences will be
similar to the certificates of approval currently issued by the Gaming Board under
section 19 and Schedule 5 to the Gaming Act 1968. The requirement for operating
licence holders to retain personnel who hold a personal licence is set out in Part 3 of
the Bill. Unless the operator is a small-scale operator under clause 24, clause 23
provides that the Commission is to use its condition making powers to ensure that for
each operating licence, at least one person occupies a specified management office

69

and holds a personal licence authorising them to perform the functions of the office.
112. The provisions of this part of the Bill will provide a consistent approach across
the gambling industry and enable the Commission to identify which posts will call for
the holder to be personally licensed. Under clause 23, the requirement for a specified
management office to be held or a specified operational function to be performed by
the holder of a personal licence will be attached to an operating licence by general or
individual condition of the Commission, or by condition of the Secretary of State.
Clause 45: Nature of personal licence
113. A personal licence will authorise holders to perform certain specified
functions in relation to gambling. The clause is wide enough to cover both those in the
position of directly providing the facilities for gambling, such as a croupier, and those
who perform certain functions in a gambling operation but do not actually themselves
provide the facilities, such as a compliance officer.
Clause 46: Application of provisions of Part 3
114. Clause 46 provides that the regime for personal licensing under Part 4 is not
intended to be a regime in its own right, but instead builds upon the regime for
operating licensing in Part 3. Part 4 is therefore to be read as incorporating all the
requirements for operating licences under Part 3, unless Part 3 is amended or added to
by specific provisions in this part or regulations under them, and any other necessary
modifications. Where regulations under this part depart from the operating licence
regime, they may make different provisions in relation to different types of function
and different circumstances.
Clause 47: Application
115. Subsection (1) of clause 47 adds particularity to the list of matters which must
be specified on a licence application under clause 14 subsection (2) for the purposes
of personal licence applications. Paragraph (c) and (f) of subsection (2) state that the
form and manner of the application must be as the Commission direct, and that any
additional information as the Commission may direct must be included in it.
Subsection (1) of clause 47 provides that in relation to personal licences, a direction
may particularly require the application to be signed by the applicant’s employer and
contain information provided by the employer or about the applicant’s employment.
116. Subsection (1)(a) of clause 17 gives the Commission a power to require the
applicant to provide information in order for it to consider the application. Subsection
(2) of clause 47 adds particularity to this for the purpose of personal licence
applications, providing that in the context of this power, the Commission may
particularly require the applicant for a personal licence to obtain information from his
employer.
117. Subsection (3) provides that for the purposes of this clause, the definition of
‘employer’ is wide enough to cover contractors as well as those under a contract of
employment. Notwithstanding the above, subsection (4) provides that a person does

70

not have to be employed in order to apply for a personal licence. A person may
acquire a licence prior to seeking employment in order, for example, to improve his
chances of finding work.
Clause 48: Initial duration
118. Clause 48 provides that subject to the provisions in Part 3 relating to
surrender, lapse, forfeiture and renewal of the licence, personal licences will be valid
for ten years. The Secretary of State will be able, by order, to replace this with a
different length of time. Any such order will not, however, affect licences already
issued.
Clause 49: No annual fee
119. In contrast to operating licences, there is to be no an annual fee for personal
licences.
Clause 50: Multiple licences
120. An individual will not be allowed to hold more than one personal licence.
Personal licences may, however, cover a number of management or operational
functions, allowing one individual to conduct a number of functions under one
licence.
Clause 51: Production of licence
121. Clause 51 gives police constables and Commission inspectors power to require
a personal licensee to produce their licence within a specified period. If the individual
is carrying on a licensed activity or is on licensed premises, then the licence must be
produced immediately. This means that a personal licence holder will be required to
keep the licence on their person when carrying on a licensed activity or when they are
on licensed premises. This is in contrast to the operating licence holder, who, unless
they are a ‘small scale operator’ can only be required to produce the licence within a
specified period.
Clause 52: Review
122. There will be no mechanism to review personal licences in the way that
operating licences can be reviewed. This does not affect the Commission’s ability to
review (and alter) the conditions of an operating licence which relate to personal
licences.
Clause 53: Renewal
123. Clause 53 provides that subject to the provisions in Part 3 relating to
surrender, lapse and forfeiture, a renewed personal licence is to be valid for ten years.
The Secretary of State may revise this duration by regulations, but regulations will not
have any effect on licences renewed prior to the point that regulations are made.
Clause 54 - 55: Disqualification and forfeiture
124. In addition to the procedure for forfeiture of a personal licence available to the
courts under clause 40, clause 54 allows a court which is entitled to make a forfeiture

71

order to order that the person be disqualified from holding a personal licence for a
period of up to ten years. This can be instead of, or in addition to, an order for
forfeiture. During this period, the Commission may not issue the person with a
personal licence. Clause 55 obliges the Commission to notify any operating licence
holder whom it believes is receiving services from a disqualified personal licence
holder, or one whose licence has been revoked, or made the subject of a forfeiture
order.
Clause 56: Conviction
125. Clause 56 requires the holder of an operating licence to notify the Commission
on becoming aware that the holder of a personal licence who acts for him in
connection with the licensed activities has been convicted of a relevant offence by a
court. It will be an offence not to comply with this requirement. The requirement to
notify will allow the Commission to reconsider the licence holder’s suitability to hold
a personal licence if they are convicted of a relevant offence, and, potentially, to
revoke the licence.

Annex B: Regulatory impact assessment
1.

Introduction

1.1

This regulatory impact assessment (RIA) assesses the impact of measures
covered in the publication of certain parts of the draft Gambling Bill in July
2003.

1.2

The Government set up an independent review of gambling law under the
chairmanship of Sir Alan Budd in 1999 to consider how gambling should be
regulated. The Review’s report, “The Gambling Review Report”, made 176
recommendations for changes to the current system of control. The report
was published on 17 July 2001 and the Department invited comments.
Around 270 formal submissions were received, together with more than
4700 letters about individual recommendations. A number of meetings were
also held with industry representatives and other stakeholders, including
representatives of faiths and charitable organisations.

1.3

The Government published its response to the report in “A safe bet for
success” in March 2002. Of the 176 recommendations made by the Review
Body, the Government announced that it was minded to implement, either in
full or part, 157, rejecting only 9, with a further 10 subject to further
consideration and consultation.

1.4

The proposals in this publication focus on the establishment of a new
regulator, the Gambling Commission, which will have wider functions,
greater flexibility to act and stronger enforcement powers than the existing
Gaming Board for Great Britain. They outline the principal function of the
Gambling Commission - the licensing of gambling operations and key
personnel. The Commission will have flexibility to impose licence conditions
on categories of licences and, where necessary, on specific operators. It will
also have powers to review licences where it believes conditions have been
breached or where there is some other threat to the objectives of regulation.
The draft clauses also outline the ways in which the Commission will be able
to use codes of practice to pursue best practice across each sector of the
gambling industry.

1.5

The Government intends to publish the full draft Gambling Bill in the
autumn. This draft Bill will be subject to thorough pre-legislative scrutiny by
Parliament. Future proposals will give local authorities responsibility for the
licensing of gambling premises and outline the new licensing regime for each
sector of the gambling industry. A detailed RIA for the full draft Gambling
Bill will be published with these further proposals.

2.

Purpose and intended effect of measure

(i)

The objective

2.1

The Government intends to modernise gambling law and ensure that it
provides a new, effective and flexible balance of regulation. The Gambling
Bill is intended to sweep away restrictions that are no longer needed or which

74

reflect assumptions about the way in which gambling has to take place that
are no longer valid. More people have become more willing to see gambling
as a mainstream leisure activity. Some of the key elements of the current
system of regulation have come to be seen as imposing unnecessary
restrictions on the ability of business to meet consumers’ wishes. One
consequence has been that, while people in Great Britain can lawfully go on
the Internet to use gaming sites based abroad, there is no provision for British
operators to provide well-regulated alternatives. The present law is also
inflexible, in the sense that much of the regulatory detail is prescribed in
statute, and cannot readily be modified to respond to developments in what
is a highly innovative and fast-moving industry. At the same time, the law
currently provides inadequate regulation in terms of fairness for participants
and protection for the vulnerable.
2.2

On the basis of these aims, the licensing objectives of the Gambling Bill and
the Gambling Commission are that:
x Gambling should be crime-free, honest and conducted in accordance with
regulation;
x Players should know what to expect and be confident that they will get it
and not be exploited; and
x There should be adequate protection for vulnerable persons, and
protection for children from the effects of harmful gambling.

2.3

To deliver these objectives, the Government will:
x Simplify regulation and ensure that it can respond flexibly to future
technological and market developments;
x Replace three Acts of Parliament governing the conduct of gambling in
Great Britain: the Betting Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963; the Gaming Act
1968; the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 and consolidate them into
one Act. It will also include consequential amendments to a number of
other Acts including the Gaming Act 1845 and the Gaming Bingo Act
1985;
x Set up a new regulator, the Gambling Commission;
x Extend choice for adult gamblers; and
x Recognise the special nature of the National Lottery, with no side betting
to be allowed on National Lottery results.

(ii) The background
2.4

The commercial gambling industry currently has a wide range of regulating
and licensing authorities. The Gaming Board of Great Britain, licensing
magistrates, local authorities, the Horserace Betting Levy Board and the
Horserace Totalisator Board exercise different regulatory functions which do
not fit today’s market where operators frequently provide a variety of
products with entirely different licensing arrangements. Licences issued are
valid for different periods, and subject to a wide variety of fees.

Gaming Board for Great Britain
2.5

The Gaming Board is a non-departmental body, funded by grant-in-aid. It
currently regulates gaming and certain forms of lotteries under the Gaming

75

Act 1968 and the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 respectively. In
particular, it:
x Issues certificates of consent for the operation of casino and bingo clubs;
x Gives prior approval to certain personnel, such as croupiers, connected
with gaming in gaming clubs, which are licensed under the 1968 Act;
x Issues certificates and permits to persons who sell, supply or maintain
gaming machines; and
x Registers lotteries above certain thresholds; and certifies external lottery
managers.
Licensing justices
2.6

Licensing justices issue bookmakers’ permits, the main source of permission
for the provision of betting, under the terms of the Betting, Gaming and
Lotteries Act 1963. Licensing justices also issue premises licences to those
holding a certificate of consent from the Gaming Board. The Licensing Board
(constituted under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976) undertakes these
functions in Scotland.

Local authorities
2.7

Local authorities license pools promoters and register society lotteries whose
total tickets fall below the threshold requiring registration with the Gaming
Board, as well as tracks for betting, arcades, family entertainment centres and
other non-liquor licence premises.

(iii) Risk assessment
2.8

There are potential risks associated in implementing the Government’s
proposals to modernise the law on gambling:

2.9

Social issues: the main issue identified in extending choice and availability of
gambling is that it could lead to an increase in problem gambling. It is
estimated that there are between 275,000 and 370,000 problem gamblers in
the UK. The Gambling Review Body recognised that some individuals
become obsessed by gambling to the point at which they cease to function
as normal members of society and may do great harm not only to
themselves and also to their families and possibly the general public. They
also recognised that their proposals would generally increase the gambling
opportunities for adults, and concluded that children are a vulnerable part of
the community for whom it is right to prescribe special rules. They were also
concerned about the broader effect on communities through an increase in
the number and size of gambling enterprises.

2.10

Crime: relaxing gambling regulations could potentially increase the risk of
criminal infiltration and money laundering.

3.

Options

3.1

There would appear to be three options regarding the regulation of the
gambling industry and operating and personal licensing. These are:

76

Option 1 – leave the legislation unchanged with the Gaming Board continuing its
current role (i.e. retain the status quo).
3.2

The current regulation and licensing of the gambling industry would continue
as set out in paras 2.4-2.7.

Option 2 – establish a new Gambling Commission with the responsibilities proposed
in “A safe bet for success”.
3.3

Under this option, the Commission would take over the licensing and
regulatory responsibilities of the current Gaming Board for Great Britain in
relation to casinos, bingo and society lotteries. In addition, it would assume
responsibility for:
x The relevant licensing, certification, registration and the associated
regulatory responsibilities for bookmakers' permits, currently undertaken
by licensing justices (and, in Scotland, by Local Licensing Boards);
x Licensing of pools promoters and society lotteries, currently undertaken
by local authorities;
x Licensing of the manufacture, sale, supply, maintenance or repair of
gaming machines; and
x Licensing of external lottery managers.

3.4

The Commission would also license and regulate gaming by means of remote
technology for the first time. It would be able to issue licences for Internet
gambling and all other forms of remote gambling, including interactive
television and mobile telephony. The Commission would not be responsible
for spread betting which is subject to regulation separately by the Financial
Services Authority, nor the National Lottery which will continue to be
regulated by the National Lottery Commission.

3.5

The Commission would license gambling operations and specified categories
of gambling industry staff. It would have powers to undertake such enquiries
as are necessary in order to reach decisions in connection with individual
licence applications. It would be able to:
x Interview applicants for operating and personal licences in order to
determine whether they meet the necessary requirements;
x Require the production of criminal records certificates from applicants for
personal and operating licences;
x Receive information from enhanced criminal records disclosures;
x Exchange information, using statutory gateways, with law enforcement
and regulatory bodies, including those in overseas jurisdictions;
x Following consultation with the industry, consumer groups and others,
develop and disseminate statutory codes of practice. Such codes may
cover subjects issues such as social responsibility;
x When granting licences, attach conditions to licences and issue relevant
codes of practice in respect of the conduct of particular types of
gambling, or the conduct of licensed operators or persons, or the
operation of particular types of gambling;

77

x Undertake reviews of operating licences (whether individual licences or
classes of licence) where some change may be necessary to ensure that
the licensing objectives are protected. Such changes may involve an
adjustment to the scope of a licence or the attachment of new
conditions. It may equally involve the removal of conditions that are
judged to have become unnecessary; and
x Issue guidance to local authorities on minimum standards and mandatory
requirements for individual categories of gambling premises, which local
authorities should be required to take into account in determining
applications for gambling licences or permits.
3.6

A key aspect of this new framework would be the Commission’s ability to
attach conditions to operating and personal licences, and to issue codes of
practice following consultation with industry and other interests. Licence
conditions would be related to the statutory licensing objectives but, within
this, the Commission would have flexibility to attach conditions focused not
just on classes of licence holders, but if it judges necessary, on individual
licensees.

Option 3 – establish a new Gambling Commission with the full range of
responsibilities proposed in the “Gambling Review Report”.
3.7

This option would establish a new regulator, the Gambling Commission, with
the main responsibilities set out under Option 2, with two exceptions:
x On the issue of personal licences, betting shop managers would need to
be licensed by the Gambling Commission; and
x All larger society lotteries and their promoters would need to register
with the Commission.

4.

Benefits

Option 1
4.1

The current system of regulation has worked reasonably well but is
increasingly unable to cope with innovations such as Internet gaming.

Option 2
4.2

This option would modernise and simplify regulation of the gambling
industry. It would create a single regulatory authority for all commercial
gambling, with the exception of spread betting and the National Lottery, so
any operator considering a new business would be able to seek permission for
any combination of gambling activities from the Gambling Commission. The
establishment of a single regulator would allow entry and compliance
controls to be applied consistently and proportionately across all sectors of
the industry.

4.3

The Commission would be able to operate independently of Government,
and will have the powers and the flexibility to respond effectively to
changing regulatory concerns and to continually seek to improve standards
of performance and social responsibility. The Commission would be able to

78

use codes of practice to ensure best practice across each sector of the
industry.
4.4

There would be better regulation of operators and key personnel as the
Commission would have the flexibility to impose licence conditions on
categories of licences and, where necessary, on specific operators. It would
also have the power to review licences where it believes conditions have
been breached or where there is some other threat to the three key
objectives of regulation.

4.5

This option accepts the need for additional personal licensing than at present,
but does not agree that betting shop manager is the right level. The
Commission would issue personal licences on the basis of an assessment of
honesty and competence and this option envisages that licences would be
required by betting operators, directors and senior managers of corporate
operators. This would ensure that the key objectives of the Bill are met in so
far as the integrity of betting would be maintained, that customers are
treated fairly and that children are protected.

Option 3
4.6

The benefits are essentially the same as in option 2 but with increased costs
and regulatory burden for the additional personal licences that would be
issued to betting shop managers but without corresponding regulatory gains,
since personal licences would be issued to those holding key operational and
management functions in betting businesses. There would also be an
increased burden on society lotteries that would otherwise not have been
required to register with the Commission.

Business sectors affected
4.7

The business sectors affected will be those connected with commercial
gambling with the exception of spread betting and the National Lottery –
casinos, bingo clubs, gaming machine arcades, family entertainment centres,
travelling showman’s fairs, gaming machine suppliers and manufacturers,
other premises that have gaming machines (including pubs), bookmakers,
racecourses, greyhound racing, lotteries and those conducting prize
competitions and promotional draws including premium rate operators,
propriety and members’ clubs, remote gaming operators and specialists, and
the tourist industry. Charities and voluntary organisations will also,
potentially, be affected by the recommendations relating to society lotteries.

Issues of equity and fairness
4.8

On the proposals regarding operating and personal licensing, each gambling
sector would be self funded and licence fees would include a charge to cover
administration and enforcement of the system, the investigation and
prosecution of, for example, unlicensed trader and the cost of appeals. The
proposals would enable the Commission to set fees more flexibly and fairly
than at present.

Costs

5.1

The compliance costs have been reviewed since the publication of “A safe bet
for success”. These will be further revised as the operational procedures for
the Gambling Commission, local authorities and appeals are developed and
will be included in the RIA for the full draft Gambling Bill.

5.2

The costs outlined for the three options below also include the proposed new
costs relating to appeals and the role of local authorities in premises licensing
for ease of comparison between the current and proposed regulatory and
licensing regimes.

Option 1 : £7.1m p.a.
5.3

Current regulatory costs are summarised on an annual basis in the following
table:

Option 2 : £11.5 – 17.9m p.a.

1

Under option 2, the Gambling Commission would regulate a far wider sector
of the gambling industry than the current Gaming Board and it will have far
wider powers. Although costs are higher than at present, they would be
directly proportionate to the work undertaken by the Commission in
regulating the industry which is anticipated to be much larger and diverse
than at present. It will be important for the Commission to be adequately
resourced to fulfil its regulatory functions to provide the confidence that the
industry and public expect in the new laws.

Annual figure based on the estimate of the number of licences for 2003/04. Gaming Board costs include certificates of
consent issued by the Board to bingo clubs and National Game, casinos, certificates to specified staff employed in casinos and
bingo halls, and to those who sell, supply or maintain gaming machines, lottery managers, and registration of certain societies’
lotteries. Costs include work undertaken by licensing justices in issuing premises licences and permits to bingo clubs, casinos
and members clubs.

5.5

The Gambling Review Report recommended that there should be a formal
duty on gambling operators to ensure that appropriate checks are made on
employees who are involved in the gambling industry (including bookmaking
employees) but are not otherwise regulated by the Gambling Commission.
How this would work in practice will be a matter for further consultation
with the industry, but it could, for example, include a requirement for
criminal records checks every five years on employees who have remained in
the same position, or who have been promoted to a position below manager
in the same company and who would not otherwise need to be re-licensed by
the Commission. The Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) will carry out criminal
records checks for individuals, on application for a fee. Basic, standard and
enhanced disclosure fees cost £29.

5.6

Estimated annual regulatory costs for option 2 are summarised on an annual
basis in the table below:

Compliance costs are very similar to option 2 except costs for the Gambling
Commission would be increased as all betting shop managers would need to
obtain personal licences.

Consultation with small business

6.1

The Small Business Service has been involved in the consultation process.
Trade organisations that have both large and small operators as members
have been consulted in preparing the policy for the Bill. The Government’s
objectives, within the overall framework for effective regulation, will be to
minimise any disproportionate impact on small business, and a number of the
specific recommendations in the “Gambling Review Report” have been
modified or rejected.

7.

Competition assessment

7.1

The Office of Fair Trading has been consulted about the proposed changes in
the Gambling Bill. It is expected that implementation of the Gambling Bill
will generally have a positive effect on competition within the sectors that
comprise the gambling industry. This view is made on the basis that the Bill
will remove many restrictions and statutory requirements for businesses that
may currently act as barriers to entry. Although the Bill will also create some
additional compliance costs, these are not expected to be sufficient to have a
significant impact on competition in any of the gambling sectors.

8.

Enforcement and sanctions

8.1

The Gambling Commission will ensure compliance and there will be an
enforcement role for local authorities. Implementation of the Bill will
facilitate better cross-agency working and sharing of information between
law enforcement bodies such as Customs and Excise, the Financial Services
Authority, the National Lottery Commission and others, which will help to
combat crime.

8.2

The Bill will contain a wide-ranging list of specific criminal offences and
sanctions that will enable effective action to be taken against those who
break the law. Operator and personal licences will be supported as an
alternative to criminal proceedings, by a flexible range of sanctions ranging
from cautions and licence endorsements to financial penalties and
withdrawal of licences.

9.

Monitoring and review

9.1

The Gambling Commission will keep the operation of the new legislation
under review and will monitor the social and economic impact of gambling,
adjust regulations as necessary and advise the Government on the need for
legislative changes. It will liaise and consult with stakeholder interests. An
annual report of its activities will be published.

Summary and recommendations

Option

Total cost per annum

Total benefit per annum

Option 1

£7.1m

No additional benefits

Option 2

£11.5 - 17.9m

Better regulation
Reduced costs for the Gambling
Commission

Option 3

£13 – 19.4m

Better regulation

11.1

It is recommended that option 2 is pursued. This would deliver the
establishment of a new regulator, the Gambling Commission, which will have
the wider functions, greater flexibility to act and stronger enforcement
powers than the existing Gaming Board that would continue to exist under
option 1. It would also result in a more proportionate and efficient system of
personal licensing than that envisaged for option 3.

Declaration
I have read the Regulatory Impact Assessment and I am satisfied that the balance
between cost and benefit is the right one in the circumstances described.
