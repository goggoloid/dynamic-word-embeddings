Post-Legislative Assessment of the
Gambling Act 2005

Introduction
1. This memorandum provides a preliminary assessment of the Gambling Act 2005
(the 2005 Act) and has been prepared by the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport for submission to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. It will be
published as part of the process set out in the document Post-Legislative Scrutiny
– The Government’s Approach (Cm 7320).

Objectives of the Gambling Act 2005 (“the 2005 Act”)
2. The main purpose of the 2005 Act was to ensure that gambling is properly
regulated through the following licensing objectives:
• preventing gambling from being a source of crime or disorder, being
associated with crime or disorder or being used to support crime,
• ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way, and
• protecting children and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or
exploited by gambling.
3. These objectives are central to the new regulatory regime created by the 2005
Act.
4. The 2005 Act also introduced:
• a unified regulator for commercial gambling1 in Great Britain – the Gambling
Commission
• a new licensing regime for commercial gambling
• a new regulatory regime for casinos and for gaming machines; and
• a revised regime for the law on lotteries
5. It also provided protection for children and adults from the effects of harmful
gambling through the creation of a number of specific offences.

Implementation and subsequent amendment
6. The Gambling Act 2005 received Royal Assent on 7th April 2005. While some of
the provisions of the 2005 Act came into force during 2005 and 2006, the majority
of the legislation came into effect on 1st September 2007.

With the exception of spread betting (which is regulated by the FSA), and the National Lottery (which is regulated by
the National Lottery Commission).

7. It generally extends to England and Wales, and to Scotland with the exceptions of
sections 148 (legal assistance scheme), 221 (fees) and 346 (prosecution by
licensing authority).
8. Sections 443 (chain gift schemes), 331 (foreign gambling) and 340 (foreign
betting) also apply to Northern Ireland.
9. There have been a number of Commencement Orders, other Orders (some of
which have amended the 2005 Act) and Regulations made under the Act. These
are listed at ANNEX A.

Provisions not brought into force
Regional casinos:
10. Following advice from the Casino Advisory Panel2 an Order put before Parliament
in March 2007 identified the local authorities who would be authorised to licence
the 17 new casinos permitted by the Gambling Act (one regional casino licence;
eight large casino licences and eight small casino licences). The Order was
approved in the House of Commons but was narrowly rejected in the Lords.
There was a clear consensus that the 16 large and small casinos should proceed
in the areas recommended by the Panel but the 17th licence for a regional casino
caused considerable concern in both Houses.
11. A new Order allowing sixteen local authorities to license a small or large casino
was laid before Parliament in February 2008 (and came into force on 19 May
2008). At the same time the Government confirmed it would not allow a regional
casino licence on the basis of the concerns expressed by Parliament in March
2007 about the potential negative impact of such a casino and other evidence
presented at the time that raised concerns about the uncertain level of risk
involved.
12. In its recent evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport committee’s inquiry into the
Gambling Act 2005, the Government has said that, given the incomplete process
for awarding the eight large and eight small casinos, it is currently not appropriate
to reconsider the establishment of a regional casino3.
Voluntary Levy for Research, Education and Treatment (RET):
13. To oversee and organise the programme of research, education and treatment,
the Budd Report4 recommended the establishment of a Gambling Trust, to be
funded voluntarily by the industry, but failing that should be funded by a statutory
levy. In response to the Budd Report recommendations, section 123 of the 2005
Act included a provision for the Secretary of State to introduce a statutory levy to

The Casino Advisory Panel was established to recommend the locations of the new casinos permitted under the

Gambling Act. The final report of the panel, published on 30 January 2007, is available on the Casino Advisory Panel
website and can be viewed at: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.culture.gov.uk/cap/

raise funds for the delivery of projects relating to addiction to gambling; other
forms of harm or exploitation associated with gambling; or any of the licensing
objectives.
14. Introduction of a levy would require regulations to be passed by Parliament, and
would require approval by the Treasury. Following the Gambling Commission’s
RET Review in 2008, the Government decided that the voluntary levy should
continue, and section 123 would not be enacted unless the voluntary approach
failed to generate sufficient funding to sustain a programme of research,
education and treatment.

Legal Issues
Airside bars:
15. As a result of section 278 of the Gambling Act 2005, the provisions in section 2825
about automatic gaming machine entitlements and section 2836 about licensed
premises gaming machine permits only apply to premises that hold an alcohol
licence under Part 3 of the Licensing Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) or the Scottish
equivalent. Section 173 of the 2003 Act and section 124 of the Licensing
(Scotland) Act 2005 prevent activities which would normally require a licence (i.e.
the sale and supply of alcohol) from being licensable if they are carried on at
specified premises. The list of specified premises effectively includes airside
bars.
16. This means that airside bars, because they are not licensable, are not able to
benefit from the gaming machine entitlements available to licensed premises.
The Department is considering a Legislative Reform Order (LRO) under the
Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 to rectify this anomaly.
On-course bookmaking
17. When it came into force on 1 September 2007, the 2005 Act repealed certain
provisions in the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963 and replaced the
previous regulatory requirement for racecourses to hold a certificate of approval
with the requirement to obtain a betting premises licence. In doing so, it ended
the previous system of bookmakers’ lists (containing each bookmaker’s pitch
position), with which a racecourse was obliged to comply as part of their
certificate, together with the rule ensuring that no on-course bookmaker was
charged more than five times the amount for entry as an ordinary race-goer.
18. Subsequent Regulations preserved ‘list positions’ and the ‘five times rule’ for five
years (until 31 August 2012) by maintaining the requirements for racecourses to
provide the same areas for on-course bookmakers as provided prior to 1
September 2007, and for the charge applicable by racecourses to on-course
bookmakers to be at five times the public admission price.

5

Section 282 permits licensed premises to make available for use up to two Category C or D gaming machines
without the need for a Gambling Act licence.
6
Section 283 permits licensed premises to apply for a permit to make available for use more than two Category C or
D gaming machines.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport
Select Committee

19. From 1 September 2012, it will be a mandatory condition of racecourse premises
licences that racecourses will still have to provide an area for on-course
bookmakers, but the five times rule will no longer apply, meaning that
bookmakers and racecourses will enter into a commercial arrangements.
Similarly, on-course bookmakers raised concerns that racecourses would no
longer recognise the existing arrangements whereby bookmakers’ allocation of a
pitch in a betting area is determined by their position on a pitch list.7
20. To aid the agreement of commercial arrangements between racecourses and
bookmakers, the Government convened a working party in 2008 under
independent chairmanship, with representation from the Federation of
Racecourse Bookmakers (FRB) and the Racecourse Association (RCA).
Following prior agreement on general principles to govern entry by bookmakers to
betting rings at racecourses and the allocation of bookmakers’ pitches from 1
September 2012, the RCA agreed in November 2009 to recognise bookmakers’
list positions in existing betting areas until at least 2052 and, in general, to
allocate pitches in new betting areas on the basis of existing pitch lists.
21. Since that time FRB representatives have been taking forward negotiations with
racecourses on the details of commercial arrangements at each course. Ministers
have received regular updates and urged that this be resolved quickly.
Employment of persons under 18 years old on ‘tracks’
22. It is presently an offence, under section 55 of the Gambling Act 2005, for a person
under the age of 18 years to be employed, in any capacity, at a track which holds
a betting premises licence at a time when betting is being offered (effectively,
throughout the period when horse/dog races, football matches etc. are taking
place).
23. This was not the original policy intention and the Department is considering a
Legislative Reform Order (LRO) under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act
2006 to amend section 55 and allow tracks to lawfully recruit and train under-18s
in various roles, such as catering and office staff, stable hands, jockeys, and dog
handlers8. The provision in section 51 of the 2005 Act, which imposes a criminal
offence for any person under 18 to be employed in the provision of gambling
facilities, would remain in place.
Scottish Local Authorities:
24. Section 310(1) does not apply in Scotland because Schedule 13 of the 2005 Act
(Provisions about Licensed Premises Gaming Machine Permits) does not have
effect in Scotland as a result of section 283(5)9.
25. Section 310(2) only relates to premises in respect of which an on-premises
alcohol licence has effect. Section 277 defines an on-premises alcohol licence by
reference to the Licensing Act 2003 – which does not extend to Scotland. Section
7

In 2007/2008, the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee considered such issues and published a report on 15
January 2008.
8
Prior to the implementation of the 2005 Act, under-18s were employed in such a way
9
“Schedule 13 … shall have effect except in relation to Scotland”.

Department for Culture, Media and Sport
Select Committee

277(c) has a separate definition for a “relevant Scottish licence”, but section
310(2) makes no reference to a “relevant Scottish licence”.
26. Section 304(2) is intended to provide local authorities with the opportunity to
empower local authority staff already involved in licensing, but does not apply to
Scotland because the officers given responsibility by Scottish local authorities
(usually Licensing Standards Officers – LSOs) are not officers of the licensing
authority10. This creates difficulties in implementing a shared regulation model, as
local authority officers in Scotland do not have the same powers of entry as their
English and Welsh counterparts.11

Post-Legislative Reviews
Fees Review:
27. 2008 - The Secretary of State undertook to review Gambling Commission fees in
the light of the Commission's experience of the first full year of compliance and
enforcement work with the industry. The fees were revised from 1 August 2009
following a public consultation in April - June of that year12.
Gaming machines:
28. Since the 2005 Act came into force, there have been three ‘reviews’ of gaming
machines focussing on stake/prize limits and machine numbers, and a review of
prize gaming limits that stemmed from the category C/D review • 2008/9 - the maximum number of category B3 gaming machines that bingo
premises could offer was increased from four to eight (Public consultation
June – Sept 2008; implemented February 2009)13;
• 2008/9 - stake and prize limits for category C and certain types of category D
gaming machines were increased (Public consultations Aug – Nov 2008 and
Dec 2008 – Jan 2009; implemented June 2009)14;
• 2009/10 - stake and limits for prize gaming (consultation with the industry Oct 2009; implemented March 2010)15;
• 2010/11 - stake limit for category B3 machines increased and B3 entitlements
for AGCs and bingo premises changed (public consultation Nov 2010 –
January 2011; implemented July 2011)16.

10

In Scotland, there are separate Licensing Boards, and LSOs are deliberately legally separated from the Boards.
Sections 304 (3) and (4) are intended to provide local authorities with the opportunity to empower staff involved in
other regulatory roles, but as most Scottish local authorities have given responsibility to LSOs instead, it does not
provide the necessary enabler for Scottish local authorities.
11
To resolve this issue would entail amendment of the 2005 Act by primary legislation.

Hampton Review:
29. The review of the Gambling Commission took place at the end of the
Commission’s first full year of operation (October 2008), following the 2005
Hampton report “Reducing administrative burdens: effective inspection and
enforcement”. The review made a number of recommendations for improving the
use of intelligence and risk analysis, better focus on outcomes, and being clearer
about the Commission’s responsibilities with regard to the economic vitality of its
regulated sector17.
Remote Gambling:
31. In 2009, there was a review of remote gambling regulation (public consultation
“The Regulatory Future of Remote Gambling in Great Britain”18 March - June
2010). In July 2011 - the Minister for Tourism and Heritage, John Penrose,
announced proposals to Parliament via written Ministerial statement19. The
proposals introduce the need for overseas operators based anywhere in the world
to obtain a Gambling Commission licence to enable them to transact with British
consumers and to advertise in Great Britain, and will result in the phasing out of
the white list. The proposals will require changes to primary legislation and
options for a legislative vehicle are currently being considered.
RET Review:
32. In 2008, the Gambling Commission undertook the Review of Research, Education
and Treatment. A new tripartite structure was set up, consisting of the
Responsible Gambling Strategy Board (RGSB), Responsible Gambling Fund
(RGF) and the Gambling Research Education and Treatment Foundation
(GREaT20). To negate the need for a statutory levy, the three-year voluntary
targets and underwriting commitments were to be reviewed and agreed annually,
following consultation.21

Preliminary Assessment of the Gambling Act 2005
33. In 2002, as set out in the Government’s White Paper “A safe bet for success –
modernising Britain’s gambling laws”22, the key intentions of the Government’s
approach to the regulation of the gambling industry were to “keep crime out,
protect the vulnerable and ensure that gambling products are fair to the
consumer”23, with the following objectives:
• to modernise gambling legislation and to consolidate it into a single piece of
flexible and comprehensible legislation;

to create a new single regulatory authority (the Gambling Commission),
funded through licence fee income, to regulate all gambling24 (with premises
licensing performed by local authorities);
to relax advertising restrictions, and the use of credit cards for payment ;
to establish a new regulatory framework for gaming machines;
to deregulate casinos and bingo, in order to provide greater choice for both
players and industry;
to legalise the provision of the full range of online gambling services by
operators located in the UK;
to provide proper controls and protections for children and vulnerable people –
as part of the conditions of licences to operate - and to ensure there is
prevention, research, education and treatment in relation to problem gambling.

34. In September 2003, a Joint Committee of the House of Commons and the House
of Lords was appointed to scrutinise the draft Gambling Bill. The Joint Committee
examined carefully the impact that the proposals in the draft Bill could have on
children and vulnerable people, and made a number of recommendations to
reduce the risks of harm that might be involved in additional consumer choice.
The Government accepted the vast majority of the recommendations of the Joint
Committee25.
35. The 2005 Act now provides a regulatory framework, with much of its powers
controlled by secondary and tertiary legislation which can be adjusted to deal with
technological and social changes - something the previous regime was unable to
do.
The Gambling Commission:
36. The Gambling Commission is the national regulator for all forms of commercial
gambling in Great Britain, except for spread betting and the National Lottery26. It
is funded by licence fees and is an independent non-Departmental public body
sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). It has a
much broader regulatory remit than its predecessor, the Gaming Board for Great
Britain.
37. In addition to covering all forms of gambling (except spread betting), the Gambling
Commission also has the licensing objective to protect young people and the
vulnerable, has the statutory duty to advise the government on the impact of
gambling and its regulation, is a prosecuting authority and is the money
laundering supervisory body for the casino sector.27
38. The 2008 Hampton Review of the Gambling Commission confirmed it takes a
risk-based approach to regulating the gambling industry. There have been some
concerns from the gambling industry that the Commission is not risk-based
enough, and that companies themselves can manage the risk of non-compliance
24

except Spread Betting, which is overseen by the FSA
In The Regulatory Impact Assessment which accompanied the Bill in 2004, the Government’s view is that
“reduction of harm should take precedence over the maximisation of innovation, consumer choice and economic
gains”.
26
The Public Bodies Bill, currently before Parliament, provides for Ministers to merge the Gambling Commission and
the National Lottery Commission.
27
There has been some confusion by operators over the role of the Gambling Commission against the role of local
authorities, with the latter responsible for local compliance and enforcement.
25

with the licensing objectives in the same way they manage other risks. The
Commission continues to keep its risk-based approach under review, and has
been considering, with the Department, how regulatory activity can best be
targeted at where it has the greatest impact. The Gambling Commission also
hopes that, in the future, it can rely more on the checks that companies undertake
themselves, taking on more of an auditing role. This offers further potential to
reduce regulatory activity away from responsible operators and focus on those
who present a higher risk.
39. The Government does not believe it is necessary to retain a separate regulator for
the National Lottery, and is proposing to merge the Gambling Commission and
the National Lottery Commission (NLC).
Local licensing authorities
40. The Government has confirmed that it believes the approach of a single national
regulator along with local licensing authorities is the right one. The Gambling
Commission and local government, however, need to continue to work together to
resolve any areas of confusion, and to ensure that there is no duplication of roles
which might lead to unnecessary additional regulatory burdens – local authorities
are responsible for local compliance and enforcement.
Regulation of online gambling:
41. The Gambling Act 2005 brought remote gambling within the regulatory framework
for the first time28, with only those operators who locate remote gambling (key)
equipment in Britain requiring a Gambling Commission licence. Overseas-based
remote gambling operators are not required to hold a Gambling Commission
licence, although section 331(1) of the 2005 Act prohibits them from advertising
unless they are situated within the EEA (including Gibraltar), or in one of the four
jurisdictions that have been ‘white-listed’29 by the Secretary of State.
42. It was hoped that a freer approach to advertising would provide maximum
reciprocal benefits for British businesses in terms of European and International
gambling markets, and that Britain would be influential in improving standards of
regulation both across Europe and internationally.
Experience suggests,
however, that the system is not working as well as intended as, at present, there
are different regulatory standards and approaches, and GB consumers may
experience varying levels of protection depending on the operator they deal with.

28

In 2001 the Gambling Review Body, chaired by Sir Alan Budd, recommended that a proposed new gambling
regulator license all forms of remote gambling. The then Government agreed with that recommendation and decided
that gambling should be deemed to take place wherever the gambling operator is based (i.e. place of supply).
29
The Gambling Act allows the Secretary of State to designate non-EEA jurisdictions permitted to advertise remote
gambling services in Britain. This is informally known as the ‘white list’. The current white list jurisdictions are Antigua
& Barbuda, the Isle of Man, the States of Alderney and Tasmania. Operators supplying gambling from these places
can advertise their services in Britain in reliance on the licence issued by their home jurisdiction (an arrangement
which is unique to the British market amongst EU Member States).

Department for Culture, Media and Sport
Select Committee

43. Following a public consultation30, the Government has recently proposed that the
2005 Act should be simplified so that all operators selling into the British market will be
required to hold a Gambling Commission licence31. The Government believes these
proposals are an important measure to help address concerns about problem
gambling and underage play. In addition, for the first time, overseas-based remote
gambling operators will be required to inform the Gambling Commission directly about
suspicious betting patterns to help fight illegal activity and corruption in sports betting.
Problem gambling and underage play:
44. The Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP) issued under section 24 of
the Gambling Act 2005 ensure the protection of children and other vulnerable
persons by requiring operators to put into place policies and procedures in
relation to combating problem gambling, preventing access to gambling by
children and young persons, the provision of information on how to gamble
responsibly and help for problem gamblers, customer interaction, and selfexclusion.
45. The Government believes that tackling underage gambling is an example of how
the new regulatory system has worked well. In 2009 the Gambling Commission
conducted a test purchasing scheme in betting shops that showed a 2% success
rate i.e. 98% of all visits resulted in underage players being allowed to gamble.
This was clearly unacceptable, but following action from the Commission, the
industry themselves took control of the situation with good results. While the
Commission and local authorities continue to undertake test purchase schemes,
this is an area where the industry itself needs to take increasing responsibility for
monitoring performance and enforcing its own safeguards.
46. The British Gambling Prevalence Study 2010 (BGPS 2010) indicated an increase
in the small proportion of problem gamblers in Great Britain since the Gambling
Act 2005 came into force. The increase was marginally statistically significant
and in the context of an increase of around 5%, or 3.5 million, in the number of
adults gambling overall. The study showed that Great Britain had a similar level
of problem gambling to other European countries, and less than the USA,
Australia and South Africa.
47. There is no evidence that indicates whether the changes in the regulation of the
gambling sector in place since 2007 have had any effect on the level of problem
gambling, either positive or negative. Government, regulators and the industry
(including those based overseas) need to do more to understand the causes and
effects of problem gambling as well as the measures that can be put in place to
prevent, limit and treat the damage it can cause.

30

The public consultation “The Regulatory Future of Remote Gambling in Great Britain” –
www.culture.gov.uk/images/consultations/remotegambling_consultation.pdf - ran from March 2010 until June 2010,
with a change of Government half way through.
31
The white list will be phased out as remote gambling operators based anywhere outside Britain will be allowed to apply for
a Gambling Commission licence

Gaming machines
48. The 2005 Act introduced a new regulatory framework for gaming machines,
including new definitions and categories of gaming machine together with powers
to prescribe, among other things, maximum limits to stakes and prizes and
machine entitlements for different types of premises. The approach to the
regulation of gaming machines under the 2005 Act has, however, led to some
unintended consequences.
49. Following implementation of the 2005 Act some operators applied for and in some
cases obtained operating licences without then providing the primary activity
authorised by the licence type (for example betting or bingo) or artificially split
their premises, both of these in order to take advantage of the gaming machine
entitlements that accrued with the licences. Consequently, the Department and
the Gambling Commission have sought to address these issues through, for
example, the introduction of a licence condition to ensure the activities taking
place reflect the nature of the licence held, more robust guidance to licensing
authorities about primary gambling activity and more flexible machine entitlements
for certain types of premises and certain categories of gaming machine.
