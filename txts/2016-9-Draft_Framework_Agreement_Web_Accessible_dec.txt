AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN HER MAJESTY’S SECRETARY OF
STATE FOR CULTURE, MEDIA AND SPORT AND THE BRITISH
BROADCASTING CORPORATION
THIS DEED is made the [

] 2016 BETWEEN:

HER MAJESTY’S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR CULTURE, MEDIA AND SPORT (“the
Secretary of State”) and
THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION whose chief office is at Broadcasting
House, Portland Place, London W1A 1AA (“the BBC”).
BACKGROUND
(1)

The BBC was first incorporated, for a limited period of time, by a Royal Charter
granted on 20th December 1926. Subsequently, further Royal Charters were granted
to the BBC to continue its existence as a corporation. The most recent of these
Charters (“the 2006 Charter”) was granted on 19th September 2006 and provides for
the continuance of the BBC for a period ending on 31st December 2016 (“the current
Charter period”).

(2)

The Secretary of State is applying to Her Majesty for the grant of a further Charter
(“the 2016 Charter”) for the continuance of the BBC for a further period ending on
31st December 2027 and which makes provision for the process of transition from the
2006 Charter to the 2016 Charter to begin before the end of the current Charter
period.

(3)

The 2006 Charter is complemented by an Agreement (“the 2006 Agreement”) made
by a Deed between the Secretary of State and the BBC dated 30th June 2006 (and
amended by further Deeds dated 23rd March 2010, 11th February 2011 and 13th
September 2011).

(4)

Among other things, the 2006 Agreement confers, by virtue of section 198 of the
Communications Act 2003 (“section 198”), certain regulatory functions, and related
powers and duties, on the Office of Communications.

(5)

The 2016 Charter contains provisions, particularly article 53, about the concept of a
Framework Agreement.

(6)

It is appropriate that the 2006 Agreement should be revoked and replaced by a new
Agreement which will be a Framework Agreement for the purposes of the 2016
Charter and make suitable provision to complement the provisions of the 2016
Charter, including provision for the purposes of section 198.

(7)

This Agreement has been prepared with the cooperation and agreement of the Office
of Communications. The consent of the Office of Communications shall be sought
1

should any future amendments to this Agreement affect their functions and related
powers and duties.
NOW in view of these considerations, THIS DEED WITNESSES that the Secretary of State
and the BBC agree with one another as follows.

INTRODUCTION
1.

Interpreting this Agreement
In reading this Agreement, the interpretation provisions in clauses 74 to 82 should be
borne in mind.

2.

Status of this Agreement as a “Framework Agreement” for BBC Charter
Purposes
This is a Framework Agreement for BBC Charter purposes. The significance of this is
explained in the Charter (see in particular article 53).

3.

Commencement of this Agreement (and revocation of previous Agreements)

(1)

This Agreement will for most practical purposes take effect as from the beginning of
the Effective Date, but that general statement must be read subject to paragraph (2).

(2)

In technical terms, this Agreement shall come into force on the day after the day on
which the Charter is granted (see the date given in the formal text following article 72
at end of the Charter), but in order to facilitate the transition from the constitutional
and other arrangements in force under the 2006 Charter to those under the 2016
Charter, the Transitional Agreement dated [ ] and Schedule 1 modifies this
Agreement’s effect (in relation to times both during and after the Transitional Period,
as defined in the Schedule to the 2016 Charter).

(3)

The Agreements listed in Schedule 1 are revoked as from the end of the day before
the Effective Date, but are also subject to the provisions of the Schedule to the
Charter and the Transitional Agreement.

(4)

In this clause:
“the 2006 Charter” means the Royal Charter for the continuance of the BBC for the
period ending on 31st December 2016; and
“the 2016 Charter” means the Royal Charter for the continuance of the BBC for the
period ending on 31st December 2027.

4.

The independence of the BBC
The parties to this Agreement affirm their commitment to the independence of the
BBC as stated in article 3 of the Charter. By entering into this Agreement, the BBC
has voluntarily assumed obligations which restrict, to some extent, its future freedom
of action.

used by the BBC or which have yet to be developed.

(4)

The BBC may make other changes to the UK Public Services in accordance with this
clause.

(5)

The BBC must prepare and publish a policy setting out how it will consider material
changes to the UK Public Services, including whether or not a change is potentially
material, and consult with interested persons where appropriate. The policy must set
out the assessment it will carry out and the procedures it will follow. Such
assessments and procedures must be in a manner proportionate to the nature of the
change.

(6)

The BBC may only make a material change to the UK Public Services where(a)
the BBC has carried out a public interest test on the proposed change;

the carrying out of any activity as a new UK Public Service; and
(b)
any change to a UK Public Service which may have a significant
adverse impact on fair and effective competition.

8.

Public Interest Test

The BBC must be satisfied that(a)
the proposed change to the UK Public Service contributes to the fulfilment of
the Mission and the promotion of one or more of the Public Purposes;
(b)
it has taken reasonable steps to ensure that there is no adverse impact of the
proposed change on fair and effective competition which is not necessary for
the effective fulfilment of the Mission and the promotion of the Public
Purposes; and
(c)
the public value of the proposed change justifies any adverse impact on fair
and effective competition,
(‘the public interest test’).

(2)

In carrying out the public interest test, the BBC must consider the scale and likelihood
of any public value relative to the scale and likelihood of any adverse impact on fair
effective and competition. It is recognised that the determination will require
qualitative assessments to be made and that direct comparison of factors relating to
public value and factors relating to risks to fair and effective competition may not be
possible.

(3)

Where the public interest test is satisfied, the BBC must publish the proposed change
and send a copy to Ofcom.

5

9.

review the procedures the BBC has followed in carrying out the public interest
test;
(b)
review the BBC’s assessment of the public value of the proposed change to
the UK Public Services;
(c)

are not funded by licence fee revenue whether directly or indirectly; and
(c)
are undertaken with a view to generating a profit (regardless of whether the
profit, generated will or may be used to fund the fulfilment of the Mission or promotion

even if it also fulfils the Mission or promotes the Public Purposes, if it is done with a
view to generating profit.

BBC in joint ventures or other forms of commercial partnership with persons or
bodies other than the BBC or a subsidiary within the BBC’s commercial arm.

separation rules in the Operating Framework.

(7)

Where the commercial activity consists of participation in a joint venture or other form
of commercial partnership with a person or body other than the BBC or a subsidiary
within the BBC’s commercial arm, the BBC must use its best endeavours to ensure
that:
(a)
the participation complies with the commercial criteria; and
(b)
any services provided, or activities undertaken, by way of or through the
venture or partnership meet the commercial criteria.

13

it is appropriate to be carried on in association with the fulfilment of the
Mission and the promotion of the Public Purposes (albeit through the separate
framework required by this paragraph); and
(b)
it is connected, otherwise than merely in financial terms, with the ways in
which the BBC fulfils its Mission and promotes the Public Purposes.

(9)

A commercial activity does not cease to be considered to fit with the Mission and the
Public Purposes just because the activity includes activities which in themselves do
not meet the requirements of paragraph (8), provided such activities support or
enable other activities that do meet those requirements.

The BBC may make changes to the commercial activities in accordance with this
clause.

(11)

The BBC must prepare and publish a policy setting out how it will consider material
changes to the commercial activities, including whether or not a change is potentially
material, and consult with interested parties where appropriate. The policy must set
out the assessment it will carry out and the procedures it will follow to consider
whether the commercial criteria have been met. Such assessments and procedures
must be in a manner proportionate to the nature of the change.

the carrying out of a new type of activity as a commercial activity (for example,
an activity previously carried out as a UK Public Service, non-service activity
or trading activity); or
(b)
a significant change to the BBC’s commercial arm,
where there is a significant risk that the change may, as a result of the relationship of
the activity with the UK Public Services, trading activities or non-service activities,
distort the market or create an unfair competitive advantage.

(4)

The BBC will be responsible—
(a)
when setting the overall strategic direction of the BBC, for defining the position
of the World Service within that strategy,
(b)
for setting the budget for the World Service (subject to paragraph (5)) and
having regard, in particular, both to the need to provide sufficient funding for
the delivery of the World Service as it is defined in the World Service Licence
and to the interests of the public); and
(c)
for assessing the performance of the World Service.

(5)

The budget for the World Service must be at least £254 million for each of the
financial years from 2017/18 to 2021/22.

(6)

Taking account of the strategy and the budget it has set, the BBC will agree with the
Foreign Secretary—
(a)
objectives, priorities and targets for the World Service;
(b)
the languages in which the World Service is to be provided; and
(c)
any changes to subparagraphs (a) and (b) including the start of a new service
in a language not currently served or ceasing entirely to provide services in a
particular language.

(7)

For the purposes of paragraph (6)(a)—
(a)
an “objective” is a medium- to long-term ambition for the World Service,
expressed in general terms;
(b)
a “priority” is an expression of the relative importance of such objectives; and
(c)
a “target” is a measurable criterion of the public value delivered by the World
Service (based, in particular, on the reach, quality, impact and value for

priorities set for the Service.

18

(8)

Without limiting the ability of the BBC and the Foreign Secretary to agree other
objectives under paragraph (6), the objectives for the World Service must contribute
to the fulfilment of the Mission and the promotion of the Public Purposes including
providing high-quality news coverage, current affairs and factual programming to
international audiences, firmly based on British values of accuracy, impartiality, and
fairness.

(9)

In addition to the specific provisions of paragraphs (4) to (8), the relationship between
the Foreign Secretary and the BBC for the provision of the World Service is based on

(a)
the BBC has full editorial and managerial independence and integrity in the

(b)
in particular, the BBC will decide the most effective and efficient way of
delivering the World Service; and
(c)
subject to compliance with the Charter and this Framework Agreement the
BBC may generate other sources of income for the World Service.

(10)

it plan and prepare the provision of the World Service.

(11)

The BBC must set, publish, review periodically and observe guidelines designed to
maintain high standards of editorial integrity and provide high-quality in the World

Expenditure on the World Service, or some part of it, or activities connected with it,
may be classified by the UK Government as Official Development Assistance (ODA).
The Treasury is responsible for forecasting in each financial year the level of
expenditure to be classified as ODA for purposes of the OECD Development
Assistance Committee led by DfID based on the level of the previous year. The BBC
must provide early warning of changes that are likely to affect this forecast and must
provide, when requested, such information as the Treasury, DfID and FCO requires
for this purpose.

(14)

The BBC may make adjustments to the budgets and spending of the World Service,
independently based on editorial judgements and the requirement to fulfil the World
Service remit as set in the World Service Licence. Nothing that the UK Government
does, either to notify World Service spending as ODA or to make future forecasts
about ODA notification, may in any way constrain that independence.

(including discussing a written report from the BBC on the performance of the Service
against those objectives, priorities and targets and giving consideration to whether
