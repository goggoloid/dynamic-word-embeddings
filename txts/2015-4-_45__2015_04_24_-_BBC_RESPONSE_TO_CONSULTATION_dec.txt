TV Licence Enforcement Review
SUBMISSION FROM THE BBC IN RESPONSE TO CONSULTATION

TV Licence Fee and the Public Interest

1.1

The BBC welcomes the opportunity to respond to the consultation document
published on 12 February 2015 as part of the TV Licence Enforcement Review
(“Perry Review”) in the UK. This is a joint response from the BBC Trust and the
BBC Executive. This section provides a summary of the BBC’s position with
subsequent sections setting out the supporting analysis and evidence.

1.2

Almost all of the UK uses the BBC each week (97% of UK adults)1 and these
audiences spend a considerable amount of time with BBC services (around 18
hours per week, on average). As Ofcom’s recent Public Service Broadcasting (PSB)
review highlights, the BBC remains the cornerstone of the UK PSB system,
providing the majority of UK PSB investment and output, and stimulating the wider
market through competition.2

1.3

The licence fee remains the best source of funding for the BBC and its public
service remit. It promotes universality through free-to-air provision and, by sharing
the cost of BBC services across a broad range of households, ensures affordability.

1.4

The public interest lies in maximising licence fee income to invest in PSB and the
delivery of the BBC’s Charter-defined remit. It is also in the public interest to
ensure that licence fee enforcement is fair and proportionate to the vast majority of
households who pay as well as to the small minority who evade.

1.5

The BBC’s objective for licence fee enforcement is therefore to achieve compliance
in order to maximise licence fee income and to minimise the number of ‘free riders’
who evade but still can gain access to the BBC’s services. In fulfilling this objective,
we also aim to meet the requirement set out in the BBC Charter that the
arrangements for “the collection of the licence fee are efficient, appropriate and
proportionate”3. Our assessment of the current system and the options for change
has been based on the Perry Review’s criteria of value for money, fairness and
proportionality.

1.6

The BBC believes that failure to hold a TV licence when one is needed should
remain a criminal offence. Our view is that a criminal framework provides the
flexibility needed to create an effective and proportionate deterrent, while helping
to ensure value for money for licence fee payers.

2

The options compared: value for money

2.1

In terms of value for money, the current criminal enforcement system has served
the licence fee payer well. It has proved to be successful in keeping evasion and
collection costs down to low levels at c.5% and 2.7% respectively. To secure

compliance a strong deterrent is necessary given that the BBC cannot prevent nonpayers gaining access to its TV services, and the evidence necessary to prove an
offence is hard to secure and must be collected directly from households.
2.2

The current criminal system also has to work to strict tests: the suspected offence
will not be prosecuted by TV Licensing4 unless certain criteria are met, including
whether there is a ‘reasonable prospect of conviction’, and the offence must then
be proved in the courts ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. This draws fewer people ‘into
the net’ than would be likely under a civil system working off a weaker evidential
test of ‘balance of probability’.

2.3

We have assessed the likely impact of alternative licence fee enforcement models
using research5 undertaken by Harris Interactive. Licence fee payers were asked
about reasons for paying the licence fee. Thirty one per cent said they pay because
“it’s the law” or “because it’s illegal not to”, and 23% “because they have to”. The
current legal framework would seem to be instrumental, therefore, in delivering
low levels of evasion.
Evasion

2.4

Harris used the research to model likely evasion rates under a civil enforcement
option. The research found that the delay and evasion rates would worsen
significantly in a civil framework. Under the current criminal model, c.5%6 of the UK
population evade and 8.5% delay paying the licence fee. If the enforcement model
changed to a civil model, the research suggests that evasion and delaying figures
would increase to c.9% and c.11% respectively7. See table below.

2.5

An increase in evasion of this order would have a serious financial impact on the
provision of BBC services and public service broadcasting: every one percentage
point increase in evasion means a reduction of around £40m in the licence fee
income collected which, at the predicted level of increase in evasion, would
translate to around £150m per annum of lost income. This would lead to significant
cuts in BBC content and services, to the detriment of licence fee payers and the
UK’s creative sector.

2.6

The level of deterrence likely to result from the civil options depends primarily on
the size of the financial penalty imposed. Based on the Harris research9, the level of
penalty would likely have to increase to around £500 to provide a comparable
incentive for people to comply with the law. By contrast, the bundle of deterrents
under the current criminal system would appear to be effective in keeping evasion
at a low level.

2.7

These results tally with Harris’s findings that the public identify criminal deterrents
as more effective than civil in ensuring they pay the licence fee. In particular, as set
out in the table below, whilst a penalty of the order of £1,000 emerges as the single
most effective deterrent in principle, this is significantly out of kilter with the
current average fine level of £16910, leaving the criminal deterrents as the most
effective factors. Civil consequences, including the fact of being the subject of a
county court judgment, receiving visits from debt collection agencies or bailiffs, and
getting a bad credit rating, emerge as much less effective as deterrents.

Scotland is a relevant illustration of an out-of-court settlement scheme. In March
2014 evasion in Scotland was materially higher than in England and Wales at 7.3%11,
a difference which we believe is due in part to a difference in enforcement systems.
Collection costs

2.9

The BBC has also looked at the likely impact on collection costs of introducing a
civil model. Currently, costs awarded by the courts and subsequently recovered by
TV Licensing partially offset the BBC collection costs required to manage evasion.
Under a civil model, we estimate that collection costs would increase due to the
higher evasion rates and, with no recovery of costs through the courts, costs to the
BBC would be around £45m12 per annum higher.

2.10 Therefore, we estimate that a move to a civil model would likely result in a financial
impact on licence fee payers of around £200m per annum: lost income at c.£150m
and increased collection costs at c.£45m. This would virtually double the current
cost of evasion, and outweigh any financial savings to the magistrates’ courts from a
move to a civil system. We estimate that the costs to the courts of enforcement,
under the current system, are largely or wholly borne by those who evade through
the payment of financial penalties.

3

The options compared: fairness and proportionality

3.1

TV Licensing takes extensive steps to help the public in paying for their TV licences,
reduce barriers wherever possible and support those who may for financial reasons
find it hard to remain licensed. Whilst the deterrent is strong under the current
system, the BBC’s policy of prosecution is therefore one of last resort.

3.2

Furthermore, the courts have an obligation to take into account the seriousness of
the offence and the individual’s financial means when setting the level of any fine for
non-payment of the licence fee. Whilst the maximum fine is £1000, the average fine
level is £16913, with over a third of people paying less than £100.14 This degree of
discretion is unlikely to be available under the fixed penalty (criminal or civil)
proposals within which it is likely fines would have to be dispensed without
reference to the individual’s ability to pay. Under the current system, imprisonment
for non-payment of fines is also a last resort. Magistrates can only order this for
wilful or culpable failure to pay fines and where the court has considered or tried all
other methods of enforcement15. We understand the cases of imprisonment are
likely, in many instances, to be related to other fines not just TV Licensing offences.

appears to the court that they are inappropriate or unsuccessful.

3.3

TV Licensing under the current system provides the opportunity for the majority of
first time offenders to avoid prosecution, through its assessment of whether a
prosecution is in the public interest. Without the necessity to introduce any change
to the prosecution structure (say, along the lines of the Procurators Fiscal in
Scotland), it is our judgment that the public interest assessment combined with the
prospect of the new Single Justice Procedure (SJP) will constitute a de facto out-ofcourt settlement system. In particular, the SJP will provide for cases in England and
Wales to be considered on the papers by a single justice, analogous to the role of
the Procurators Fiscal in Scotland, which combined with the public interest test will
ensure that court time is focused on cases where it is most required. It is our view
that this model delivers the benefits of the Review’s alternative criminal options
while mitigating the risks inherent in them, namely compromising the deterrent
factor and so increasing evasion, and avoids the incremental costs of adding a new
infrastructure in England and Wales to manage out-of-court settlements.

3.4

Civil models raise a number of important fairness and proportionality issues. A key
concern is that by increasing licence fee evasion and collection costs, civil models
could lead to a sense of unfairness amongst the vast majority of the population who
pay the licence fee - particularly if the resulting reduction in revenue to the BBC
necessitated cuts to content and services.

3.5

The BBC believes that a civil enforcement model would be less targeted than the
current criminal system where penalties are only sought and applied where
necessary as a last resort. In particular, as the evidential threshold for establishing
that a household or business is evading would be lower under civil enforcement
(‘on the balance of probability‘) it would be possible to establish, for certain
addresses, that an offence is likely to be taking place, without the necessity of
carrying out a visit to collect evidence. For example, those who have let their
licence expire and are delaying a renewal could reasonably be assessed as still
requiring a licence. Consequently, the move to a civil model could result in much
larger numbers of households and businesses being penalised for licence fee evasion.

3.6

In contrast to the current system where prosecutions against the majority of first
time offenders are dropped if a licence is bought prior to the hearing, all offenders
would need to be treated in the same way under these alternative options. Also, if
the out-of-court settlement is to be an appropriate deterrent, then the penalty
would have to be set at such a level as to impose a larger financial burden on
evaders than the current fine structure (see para 2.6).

4

The BBC’s proposals to the Review

4.1

The BBC’s assessment is that the current system with targeted reforms represents
the best option for delivering the review’s objectives and maintaining funding for
public service broadcasting. We would like to propose a number of changes for
consideration by the Review.

6

Proposed reforms to the current model – Fairness and proportionality
4.2

As set out in para 3.4, TV Licensing’s current application of the public interest test
when considering prosecution already amounts to a de facto out of court
settlement system. To increase the perceived fairness and proportionality of the
current regime, the application of this public interest test could be formalised and
made more transparent. For example, TV licensing could publish a code which
would set out the steps it will take before prosecuting, and the considerations it will
apply in deciding whether it is in the public interest to bring a prosecution.

4.3

Unlike the situation currently where visiting officers are not authorised to advise
the alleged offender on what the next steps would be, this code could be made
available on the doorstep to make it clear how further action could be avoided (e.g.
by becoming licensed if they are a first time offender), rather than by letter
following the visit as currently happens.

4.4

We recognise that, in some circumstances, a first time offender may wish to make a
commitment to buy a licence and thereby avoid a court appearance but that the
payment schemes that TV Licensing is able to offer are not suitable for them. The
requirements of the instalment schemes as set out in the Regulations16 mean that
the first year’s licence must be paid for within a maximum of 6 months, creating a
barrier to payment for some. Evasion can also occur where people with licences
have failed to pay for them and had their licences cancelled. The BBC would like to
see increased flexibility in the instalment schemes, to allow TV Licensing to adapt
payment plans to suit the individual and help them to stay licensed.
Proposed reforms to the current model – Value for money

4.5

Currently if a household is unlicensed TV Licensing may have no record as to
whether the household is occupied or the names of the occupiers. Correspondence
to households where individuals are unnamed has a poorer response rate. If the
BBC were to have access to improved sources of data, such as electoral roll or
council tax databases, TV Licensing would be better able to determine which
households are potentially licensable and who is the responsible person. This would
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of licence fee collection, releasing greater
resource for investment in BBC programmes and services for licence fee payers.

4.6

The BBC believes that these reforms would improve the fairness of the current
system without weakening significantly its deterrent effect.

16

The Communications Act 2003 Section 365(1) provides that payments must be set out in Communications
(Television Licensing) Regulations 2004. Thus, the regulations for instalment schemes must specify the precise
amount of every instalment, with no discretion for TV Licensing to vary the operation of the scheme.

TV Licence Enforcement Review
DETAILED ANALYSIS AND EVIDENCE

5

TV licence enforcement and the public interest

5.1

The BBC believes that the licence fee is, and remains, the best way to fund the BBC,
working as it does both in principle and in practice.

5.2

As a matter of principle, it is levied near-universally to fund universally available
services for UK17 audiences. Furthermore it:
 promotes universal access to public service broadcasting by enabling free-toair provision of the BBC’s services, the costs of which are shared across a
wide range of households thus ensuring the licence fee is affordable;
 provides risk capital for the British creative sector by allowing the BBC to take
creative risks – on content, talent and technology – which may not always be
possible for commercial providers, to the benefit of the whole creative sector.
The licence fee accounts for around 40% of the total investment in UK original
TV content each year;
 extends choice for audiences by enabling the BBC to provide high quality UK
content across a wide range of genres, ranging, for example, from trusted
news coverage to landmark national events and globally successful drama
output; and
 promotes independence and accountability by providing the BBC with funding
for public service content, which is independent of both Government and the
commercial sector, and which licence fee payers know is collected (for the
most part) for the BBC.

5.3

In practice, rates of licence fee evasion and collection costs are low by historic and
international standards, at around 5%18 and 2.7%19 respectively, and public support
for the licence fee is strong, with some 53% of people identifying it as the best way
to fund the BBC – up from 31% in 2004 and more than double the ratings for
subscription (17%) and advertising (26%)20. Indeed the licence fee is the top choice
for funding the BBC across all ages, and all socio-economic groups, regardless of
whether people are in free-to-view21or pay TV22 households.23

5.4

Therefore, whilst there are emerging challenges for the licence fee, for example
increasing on-demand consumption of TV programmes, these can and should be
dealt with by modernising the licence fee for the internet age.

5.5

Furthermore, as the licence fee remains the best way to fund the BBC, the
17

There are some differences in the enforcement regimes in the Devolved Administrations, and the Crown
Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, and where this is relevant to the argument, such as in
Scotland, then these differences are explained. As broadcasting is not a devolved activity, all jurisdictions are
covered by the provisions of the Communications Act 2003.

maintenance of a successful TV licensing enforcement framework is also vital, both
for licence fee payers and the creative economy. The BBC believes that the current
enforcement framework and options for reform should, therefore, be tested
robustly before any changes are made.
5.6

Our assessment of the options is focused on the criteria set out in the Review’s
terms of reference, particularly value for money, fairness and proportionality, since
these are fundamental to determining whether any changes in enforcement would
serve the public interest. In particular, we use these criteria to identify and assess
the key advantages and disadvantages of each method of enforcement.

5.7

Key public interest considerations in relation to value for money include the extent
to which any reform might:
 cause rates of evasion to rise thus drawing funding away from its intended
purpose for the production and distribution of public service content in
the UK for licence fee payers;
 reduce or increase the overall cost to the UK of operating the TV licence
enforcement framework; and
 ensure the costs of enforcement continue to be borne by those who evade
(rather than by the court system or those who pay), thus creating suitable
incentives for members of the public to meet their obligation and pay.

5.8

Value for money is crucial to the public interest because it impacts very directly on
the BBC’s ability to meet its public service remit from its agreed funding envelope the public service remit and associated funding being factors which are determined
explicitly by Government for the benefit of UK licence fee payers and the creative
economy.

5.9

The BBC is a body corporate constituted by Royal Charter. The BBC exists to
serve the following six public interest outcomes, or ‘Public Purposes’:
1. Sustaining citizenship and civil society
2. Promoting education and learning
3. Stimulating creativity and cultural excellence
4. Representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities
5. Bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK
6. In promoting its other purposes, helping to deliver to the public the
benefit of emerging communications technologies and services and, in
addition, taking a leading role in the switchover to digital television.

5.10 Pursuant to the Charter, the Agreement between the BBC and the Secretary of
State for Culture, Media and Sport then sets out the BBC’s public obligations in
more detail including the arrangements for the BBC’s funding.
5.11 The Charter and Agreement are the means by which the Government define and
affirm the contribution which the BBC must make to the public interest in the UK.
These instruments also establish a funding mechanism which the Government and
Parliament consider appropriate to do this. Reductions in the level of income
10

available to the BBC for public service content and services, for example due to
increased licence fee evasion or collection costs, could therefore significantly
jeopardise the BBC’s ability to deliver its remit.
5.12 It is important for the public interest that TV licence enforcement is fair to the vast
majority of those who pay the licence fee, as well as to the small minority who
evade. The Government and the BBC have a responsibility to ensure that those
who do comply with the law and pay the licence fee do not subsidise those who
‘free ride’ by evading. A further imperative is to minimise the proportion of licence
fee payers’ money that is spent on enforcement and not on content and services.
5.13 Proportionality considerations include the public interest in funding public service
broadcasting, and the extent to which the regime is assessed to be appropriate
given the particular challenges of licence fee collection. These include the BBC’s
inability to withhold services from unlicensed households (see section 6), and the
evidence base necessary to prove an offence has taken place short of an admission
of guilt.
5.14 Taking fairness and value for money together, the BBC’s objective is to ensure an
enforcement framework which achieves compliance with the law to maximise
licence fee income to support public service broadcasting, whilst being appropriate
and fair, and cost-effective. These priorities are set out in the BBC Charter,24 under
which the BBC Trust has a duty to ensure that arrangements for the collection of
the licence fee are efficient, appropriate and proportionate.

6

Retain the current system: (do nothing, option 1)

6.1

The BBC is required to issue TV licences and collect the licence fee under the
terms of the Communications Act 2003. “TV Licensing” is a trademark used by
companies contracted by the BBC to administer the collection of television licence
fees and enforcement of the television licensing system.25

6.2

The BBC believes that failure to hold a TV licence when one is needed should
remain a criminal offence. The BBC’s objective is to achieve a high level of
compliance while acting in a fair and proportionate way. Our view is that a criminal
framework provides the flexibility needed to create an effective and proportionate
deterrent, while helping to ensure value for money for licence fee payers.

24

Article 24(2)(m).
The majority of the administration of TV Licensing is contracted to Capita Business Services Ltd. Over-the
counter services are provided by PayPoint plc in the UK, and by the Post Office in the Isle of Man and Channel
Islands. Marketing and printing services are contracted to Proximity London Ltd. Media services are contracted
to Mediaedge:CIA International Limited.

Fairness and proportionality
TV Licensing: how it facilitates compliance with the law
6.3

TV Licensing takes extensive steps to help the public in paying for their TV licences,
reducing barriers wherever possible and supporting those who may for financial
reasons find it hard to remain licensed. For example:


There is a wide range of means by which people can pay for their TV
licences. Not everyone can or chooses to pay the full fee immediately and
the Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004 provide
licence fee instalment schemes to spread payments quarterly, monthly or
fortnightly. Over 70% of households who need to buy a licence choose to
pay by direct debit26. Others pay in full over the phone or online with a
debit or credit card or by posting a cheque. Cash payments can also be
made in instalments at a PayPoint outlet. The payment schemes are
publicised through TV Licensing communications direct to customers, on
the TV Licensing website and through money advice organisations27.



TV Licensing’s extensive social inclusion programme targets hard-to-reach
and low income communities, helping to raise awareness of when a licence
is needed, the many ways to pay, and the consequences of watching TV
while being unlicensed. TV Licensing does this by engaging with national
and local organisations which provide trusted advice and support to people
in these communities. A large part of this involves partnering with advice
organisations and debt management charities. In 2013/14 it worked with
nearly 70 national and 360 local groups of all kinds: housing associations;
money advice organisations; and minority group organisations28.

6.4

In addition, TV Licensing gives members of the public significant opportunity to
comply voluntarily with the law, only moving to enforcement where these efforts
have been unsuccessful.

6.5

TV Licensing sends out a number of letters to unlicensed addresses reminding
occupants of the importance of being properly licensed and giving information on
the many ways they can pay. All communications are regularly reviewed to ensure
that they are appropriate for diverse audiences - that they are simple and clear to
understand for all levels of reader, and sensitive in tone. TV Licensing
communications sets out when a licence is needed, what actions need to be taken,
and the consequences of not taking action. TV Licensing offers a phone translation
service which allows customers to set up or pay for a TV licence over the phone in
more than 180 languages. TV Licensing leaflets are available in 20 languages, and
information on the TV Licensing website is available in 17 languages.

12

6.6

If, after repeated attempts to contact by letter, the household remains unlicensed,
or has not contacted TV Licensing to say they do not need a licence, the address
will be selected for a visit from a visiting officer.

6.7

Visiting officers operate to a strict code of conduct, have no right of entry, and can
only enter a household with the consent of an occupier. The only exception to this
is when TV Licensing obtains a search warrant29 where there is evidence of evasion
and the householder refuses entry.

6.8

There is a robust process for ensuring that those who do not need a TV Licence
can declare this. Whilst around 95% of households do watch live TV on a TV or
other device, equally some do not watch any TV at all or only ever watch on
demand or catch-up TV, in which case they do not need a TV licence. These
households - and businesses - can let TV Licensing know by completing a voluntary
‘no licence needed’ declaration. Once received TV Licensing will register this on its
database and, subject to checks on a sample of addresses, will stop communications
for a period of two years (three years for businesses) and then resume to request
reconfirmation of the declaration as circumstances may have changed (e.g. the
occupants may have moved house or begun watching or recording live television).
Proportionality in relation to prosecutions and penalties

6.9

In the consultation document it was acknowledged that individuals are given ample
opportunities to avoid a prosecution being taken forward.30 In considering a
prosecution, the evidence collected must be of sufficient quality to achieve the
threshold needed to bring a prosecution, namely there must be a “reasonable
prospect of conviction”, under the Code for Crown Prosecutors31. TV Licensing
will only take this step when households or businesses do not respond to other
forms of communication. The resources required and the quality of evidence
needed mean that this step is not taken lightly.

6.10 If a visiting officer visits a household and finds evidence that TV is being viewed at an
unlicensed address then a prosecution statement is taken to document evidence of
a suspected offence. Once this evidence has been collected, TV Licensing applies a
range of tests before pursuing a prosecution. Cases are only brought if the evidence
is of sufficient quality to pass the evidential test of the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
6.11 Once the evidential test is met, TV Licensing applies the public interest test from
29

A magistrate (in England and Wales), a sheriff (in Scotland) or lay magistrate (in Northern Ireland) may grant a
search warrant if he or she is satisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for believing (i)
that a TV licensing offence has been or is being committed; (ii) that evidence of the offence is likely to be found
on the specified premises (or vehicle); and (iii) that there is no one able to grant access to the premises, vehicle
or evidence with whom it is practicable to communicate, or that entry will not be granted unless a warrant is
produced, or that the purpose of the search may be frustrated or seriously prejudiced unless it carried out by a
person who secures entry immediately upon arrival.

the Code, i.e. whether it is in the public interest to prosecute in a particular case.
The public interest is assessed by weighing factors for and against prosecution,
taking into account the circumstances of each particular case. The overriding public
interest is to ensure people comply with the law and buy a TV licence. In the vast
majority of cases, if first time offenders buy a TV licence prior to the hearing, they
will not be prosecuted.
6.12 This application of the public interest test can be viewed as offering a de facto out
of court settlement process. It ensures compliance and diverts many cases away
from the courts. Its disadvantage is that it could encourage evasion, since some
individuals may consider it worthwhile delaying buying a licence. To address this risk,
while TV Licensing does ensure that all first time offenders are made aware they
can buy a licence and not be prosecuted, unless other factors in a particular case
weigh in favour of prosecution, it does not actively promote the factors it considers
when applying the public interest test. This is addressed in more detail in section 6
looking at wider reforms.
6.13 For cases that are prosecuted and result in a guilty verdict, the regulations
governing the magistrates’ court ensure that individuals are treated fairly and that
penalties imposed are proportionate.
6.14 Magistrates are required under the Magistrates Courts’ Sentencing Guidelines32 to
take account of the seriousness of the offence (in the case of TV licensing offences,
whether the defendant has been evading for more or less than six months), and an
individual’s financial circumstances, including income and employment status, when
setting the fine, and the time by which it needs to be paid. As a result, whilst the
maximum fine for licence fee non-payment is currently £1,000, the actual average
fine levied in 2013/14 was £16933, over a third of people paying less than £10034.
6.15 No one can be imprisoned for licence fee evasion. The magistrates’ court has
powers to send people to prison if they do not pay the fines imposed by them. The
law 35 places strict obligations on the magistrates before they can imprison for nonpayment of fines. The magistrates can only order imprisonment when there has
been wilful or culpable failure to pay any fines and where the court has considered
or tried all other methods of enforcement. Importantly, we understand that in
addition to TV licence related fines, there are very likely to be a number of fines
outstanding related to other offences.
6.16 People are therefore only sent to prison where they have deliberately and
persistently refused to comply with the court’s order and so happens very rarely.
The latest data from Government shows that, in the nine month period Jan-Sept

2014, 34 people received an average sentence of 18 days36 (with actual time served
likely to be less than this). As a comparison, in 2012, 107 individuals were
imprisoned for failure to pay council tax (a civil infraction)37.
6.17 Licence fee evasion does not appear to be more prevalent in less well-off
households; an analysis carried out by TV Licensing found that the socio-economic
split of unlicensed addresses reflects that of the total population38. The Government
has confirmed that “no information is available in respect of [the] socio-economic status
of those prosecuted or convicted or imprisoned for non-payment of a fine in respect of
television licence evasion”39.
Value for money
6.18 The existing criminal system delivers good value for money for both licence fee
payers and taxpayers (i.e. those who fund the court system), as well as ensuring that
the financial burden sits appropriately with those convicted of the offence. The
financial liability for evasion is thereby positioned appropriately and efficiently on
those who evade.
Low levels of evasion and collection costs
6.19 Licence fee evasion in the UK has fallen markedly over the last 25 years and has
remained low for the past five years at around 5%. (See graph below). This level
represents a reduction of more than 50% from the 12% figure when the BBC took
over responsibility for collection of the TV licence from Government in 1991, an
improvement which we believe reflects the BBC’s considerable work since 1991 to
improve regular payment and compliance with the law within the existing criminal
system.
6.20 At around 5% the UK’s evasion rate is also one of the lowest evasion rates in
Europe, lower than for a range of countries which are otherwise largely comparable
to the UK with respect to their public service broadcasting infrastructure and welldeveloped legal systems.
6.21 Collection costs are also low at £102m or 2.7%40 of licence fee revenue in 2013/14.
This compares favourably, for example, with Sky’s costs for subscriber
management.41

6.22 Licence fee collection costs as a proportion of licence fee revenue are also more
than 50%42 lower than they were in 1991 when the BBC took over collection from
the Government. This reflects for the most part continuing improvement in TV
Licensing’s processes and contracting arrangements, as well as the efforts to
improve collection and enforcement processes to reduce evasion over time, cutting
down the administrative burden of enforcement and prosecutions

6.23 Low evasion and collection costs indicate that the current enforcement system
provides good value for money for licence fee payers. In particular, low evasion
helps ensure enforcement costs are minimised for taxpayers, and that the funds
allocated to the BBC by Government for public service content and services are
received as intended and used in this way to the benefit of licence fee payers and
the creative sector. Low collection costs indicate a relatively small financial cost for
ensuring compliance with the licence fee.
Courts costs and the allocation of the enforcement burden to evaders through fines
6.24 A crucial issue is the extent, and appropriateness, of any net costs to the
magistrates’ court system of handling TV Licensing cases. The BBC believes that
these costs have been overstated in the consultation document.
6.25 Whilst licence fee evasion cases make up around 13%43 of magistrates’ court
criminal cases, the vast majority of cases are heard uncontested and in bulk with
offenders mostly electing not to attend44. As a result the average court presentation

time is very low, at only 56 seconds per case45, and licence fee cases are therefore
likely to account for a significantly smaller proportion of court time – and therefore
cost – than their volume might suggest. For example, the 56 seconds figure suggests
a court time cost of c.£0.5m46 per annum, many times smaller than the £8-9m47
implied by figures set out in the consultation annex, based on an assumption that
TV Licensing cases account for the same proportion of court time and costs as they
do the volume of cases.
6.26 In addition, whilst the courts also bear enforcement costs in relation to TV
Licensing cases, as TV Licence evasion is a relatively low level offence attracting an
average fine of c.£170, we do not believe that the estimate of £8-9m for TV
Licensing court enforcement costs - implied by calculations set out in the annex48 is likely to be accurate. It assumes that enforcement for TV Licensing cases, the vast
majority relating only to fines, is representatives in terms of enforcement cost for
magistrates’ courts’ caseload as a whole.
6.27 Furthermore, the BBC considers it may be likely that court time and enforcement
costs are more than compensated for by the fines recovered by magistrates’ courts
in relation to TV Licence evasion offences. Whilst data on the quantity of fines
recovered is not available from The Ministry of Justice, it is possible to construct an
estimate based on parallel data on the proportion of costs awarded to TV Licensing
which TV Licensing later then recovers.
6.28 Taking the financial year 2013/14, the courts awarded total costs of £13.1m49 to TV
Licensing in relation to the prosecution of TV Licensing offences, of which £9.5m
was received, representing a recovery rate of 73% (in fact low, given the rates of
recovery experienced in other years). As fines imposed were around £25m50 then,
assuming a similar recovery rate as for costs, magistrates’ courts may have received
in the order of £18m of fine income for TV Licensing offences, significantly in excess
of the calculated costs to the courts on any of the estimates available.
6.29 As a result, we believe that net costs to the Exchequer of licence fee enforcement
are likely to be modest at worst, indicating that much of the financial cost of
enforcement is transferred successfully and efficiently to those convicted of TV
Licensing evasion offences, and so providing an efficient incentive for compliance
with the law. Costs incurred by TV Licensing, acting on behalf of the BBC, in
bringing prosecutions are mitigated by the costs recovered by TV Licensing.

6.30 Importantly, The Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015, which received Royal
Assent on 12 February 2015, will further reduce the cost of handling TV Licensing
cases. In particular it will streamline ‘high-volume, low-level regulatory cases’ to be
determined by a single justice, on the papers, obviating the need to bring
uncontested licence fee cases to full court and so further reducing the amount of
court time dedicated to TV Licensing cases.
Summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the current system
6.31 The current criminal system has been successful in delivering low evasion and
collection costs, ensuring value for money for both taxpayers and licence fee payers.
Furthermore, our assessment is that net costs to the court system are modest at
worst, as costs incurred are likely to be largely balanced by fines received by the
courts. The financial liability for evasion is thereby positioned appropriately and
efficiently on those who evade. In providing a strong deterrent the system is also
fair to licence fee payers who expect those who watch TV to pay and not to ‘freeride’.
6.32 The current criminal system also has to work to strict evidential tests of the
suspected offence – i.e. ‘reasonable prospect of prosecution’. This draws fewer
people “into the net” than would be likely under a civil system working off a weaker
evidential test of balance of probability.
6.33 We believe that a strong deterrent is appropriate given the public interest in
securing funding for public service broadcasting and necessary given the practical
challenges involved. Moreover, the high barrier set means that prosecutions are
only pursued as a last resort and where strict evidential and public interest tests are
met; and the fact that magistrates are required to exercise discretion and
proportionality in the application of penalties to those convicted.

7

Alternative civil enforcement options: civil monetary
penalty (option 5) and civil debt (option 6)

7.1

Under a civil monetary penalty, option 5, the offence of evasion would be
decriminalised and enforced as a civil infraction. If the individual failed to pay the
penalty, the penalty would be treated as a debt and be recoverable through
proceedings in the civil courts51.

7.2

Under option 6, evasion would no longer attract a penalty of any kind. Licence fees
that would have been paid had the individual complied with the law and had a TV
licence would be recoverable as a debt in the civil courts. This would necessitate a
substantial change to the law which currently provides that the licence fee is only
payable when a TV licence is issued.
51

To recover unpaid licence fee as a debt, the legislation regarding the requirement for a licence would need
changing to make clear the period for which the licence fee is recoverable. Currently, the licence fee only falls
due when a licence has been issued to an individual.

Value for money
7.3

A move to a civil enforcement model would, in our view, increase licence fee
evasion and collection costs, likely significantly, reducing value for money for both
licence fee payers and taxpayers.
Evasion

7.4

Evidence of the impact of the current and alternative enforcement models is
available from research52 by Harris Interactive commissioned by the BBC on
perceptions and behaviour in relation to the licence fee. Harris asked licence fee
payers about their reasons for paying the licence fee. Whilst a small group, some
14%, said they purchased a licence in order “to watch TV”, many more cited the
current legal framework, including 31% cent who said they pay because “it’s the law”
or “because it’s illegal not to” and 23% who say they pay “because they have to”.
The current legal framework is instrumental, therefore, in delivering low levels of
evasion.

7.5

Taking these insights and a range of other survey data on behaviour, Harris then
modelled likely evasion rates under a civil enforcement model. The research found
that the delay and evade rates would worsen significantly in a civil framework.
Under the current criminal model, at the time the research was carried out in
autumn 2014, c.5%53 of the UK population evaded and 8.5% delayed paying the
licence fee. If the enforcement model changed to a civil model, the modelled
research suggests that evasion and delaying figures would increase to around 9%
and around 11% respectively54. See table below.

point increase in evasion means a reduction of around £40m in the licence fee
income collected which, at these predicted levels, would translate to around £150m
in reduced income (plus increased collection costs – see below). This would lead to
cuts in content and services for licence fee payers, including the significant
possibility of whole service closures. Cuts in BBC provision would also harm the
wider UK creative sector. We note Ofcom’s observation in its PSB review on the
system-wide risks from reductions in the BBC’s licence fee income. The increase in
the number of delayers is also not without cost; although they eventually pay they
require additional communications in order to persuade them to do so. By contrast,
most payers pay by direct debit.
7.7

Whilst actual behaviour cannot necessarily be predicted to follow directly and
precisely from research-based modelled behaviour, a change in enforcement to a
civil framework carries a material risk of significant revenue loss.

7.8

The research also found that the level of evasion under the civil model is highly
sensitive to the amount of the penalty. This makes sense as the research found that
the financial penalty is seen as the only significant deterrent in the civil model. Based
on the modelling done in this research55, the penalty would have to be as high as
£500 to achieve an evasion rate of 5.4%, which is similar to that today. At £150,
close to the current average fine level of c£170, evasion would rise to around 9%.
At a penalty of £80 it would rise to around 14%.

7.9

These results tally with Harris’s findings that the public identify criminal deterrents
as more effective than civil in ensuring they pay the licence fee. In particular, as set
out in the chart below, whilst a penalty of the order of £1,000 emerges as the single
most effective deterrent in principle, this is significantly out of kilter with the
current average fine level of £169, leaving the criminal deterrents as the most
effective factors. Civil consequences, including the fact of being the subject of a
county court judgement, receiving visits from debt collection agencies or bailiffs, and
getting a bad credit rating, emerge as much less effective as deterrents.

Other research on the impact on evasion of different enforcement models
7.10 In light of this data we do not believe that the Review’s assumption that there
would be no change to evasion in a move to civil enforcement is either neutral or a
necessary generalisation. The assumption appears to be based on a US academic
article from 200457, which argues that penalty levels tend not to impact offending
rates, except in atypical cases. The argument is based on a combination of
theoretical and empirical analysis, much of the latter equivocal and relating to
violent crimes not similar to licence fee evasion. The Harris research in contrast is
based on recent data for the UK and focuses directly on TV Licensing.
7.11 Whilst we agree that many factors go into determining whether someone will
comply with the law, we do not believe that the behavioural barriers highlighted by
the article for compliance are sufficiently prevalent for TV Licensing as to make the
type of penalty immaterial. Licence fee evasion is a long-standing offence and
generally understood to be illegal. Indeed some 54%58 of people indicate that they
buy a TV Licence because it’s the law, it’s illegal not to, and because they have to,
and 57% say they think it’s very likely or fairly likely that those who evade will be
caught59. Regular contact from TV Licensing serves to reinforce the licence fee
requirement and the clear pathway to prosecution and penalties for those who
evade payment.

7.12 Looking internationally, how other countries fund public service broadcasting and
operate a framework for payment collection and enforcement varies widely and
direct comparisons are not easy to make. Nevertheless there is some evidence
from looking at the European experience which suggests that countries with a weak
or unclear framework for collection and dealing with evasion and those with no
penalty defined in statute tend to have the highest levels of evasion – well into
double figures in many cases and many times the UK rate. It also highlights the
importance of having well understood deterrents, a conclusion which fits closely
with Harris’ finding that more people say they pay the licence fee because “it’s the
law”60 than for any other reason.
Collection costs and cost to the Exchequer
7.13 The BBC has looked at the likely financial costs of introducing a civil model in the
light of an increase in evasion.
7.14 Under the current model some £193m of revenue is lost through evasion. (See
table below). Costs awarded by the courts and subsequently recovered by TV
Licensing partially offset the collection costs required to manage evasion. The total
impact of evasion on the funds available for public purposes is therefore around
£213m.
7.15 Under a civil model, based on the Harris research61, evasion is predicted to rise to
9%62 with the resulting impact of evasion increasing significantly by almost £200m to
£409m. Of this £200m, some £150m is lost revenue (see para 7.6); we estimate that
in addition a civil model would lead to about £45m in incremental costs – with
collection costs far higher and no recovery of costs through the courts (See table).

7.16 The Harris research63 also identifies an increase in the rate of delayed payment.
Under a civil model those who are unlicensed as a result of not renewing their
licences on time would also be liable for a penalty. We anticipate that, under a civil
model, in excess of 800,000 late renewers (those who have delayed renewing their
licences for 5 weeks or more) could be liable for a penalty notice. The table above
shows the impact of issuing penalty notices to late renewers.
7.17 A civil model would therefore be less efficient than the current criminal model.
Even if the BBC was allowed to keep fine income to set against costs, we know that
collection of civil penalties can be both difficult to achieve and expensive. The BBC
understands that DVLA has had to write off around one third of all unpaid fines for
non-renewal of vehicle tax (a civil offence) as they are viewed too hard to collect.
Of the two thirds the DVLA pursues, less than half is paid64. The likely increase in
evasion and delay in buying a licence under a civil model will therefore increase the
costs of enforcement and mean that significantly more people would be issued with
a penalty.
Fairness and proportionality
7.18 Civil models raise a number of important fairness and proportionality issues. A key
concern is that by increasing evasion and the collection and enforcement costs
associated with those who evade, a civil model could lead to a sense of unfairness
amongst licence fee payers. As set out above, this could be reflected in cuts to BBC
content and services for licence fee payers.

Proportionality in relation to the application and level of penalties
7.19 The BBC believes that a civil enforcement model would be less targeted than the
current criminal system where penalties are only sought and applied where
necessary as a last resort. In particular, as the evidential threshold for establishing
that a household or business is evading would be lower under civil enforcement
(“on the balance of probabilities”) it would be possible to establish, for certain
addresses, that an offence is likely to be taking place, without the necessity of
carrying out a visit to collect evidence. For example, those who have let their
licence expire and are delaying a renewal could reasonably be assessed as still
requiring a licence. (See above on collection costs of evasion).
7.20 Whilst TV Licensing might in theory retain discretion in law to assess whether it is
in the public interest to apply penalties or seek recovery of the debt in all these and
similar cases, the research set out above suggests that TV Licensing would need to
take action in most cases to create a credible deterrent. This would be necessary
both to uphold the law and safeguard licence fee revenues for public service
broadcasting, as well to act fairly for the majority of people who continue to pay
the licence fee.
7.21 Consequently, the move to a civil model could result in much larger numbers of
households and businesses being penalised for licence fee evasion.
7.22 In addition, as set out in para 7.8, it is likely that the level of penalty would need to
be significantly higher than the actual fine amounts imposed under the current
criminal model (c.£170), around £500 to create a credible level of deterrent.
Furthermore, to implement the civil models efficiently for licence fee payers it is
likely the penalty level will be fixed across all cases. This is in contrast to the
current system where, by virtue of the magistrates’ court process, fines can be set
at a level that takes account of individual circumstances, including defendants’ ability
to pay and the period of time unlicensed. Losing the ability to efficiently means-test
penalties may well reduce the proportionality of the licence fee enforcement system
under a civil model.
Wider fairness and proportionality concerns
7.23 To carry out its duties cost effectively for licence fee payers, TV Licensing would
need powers to seek a range of enforcement mechanisms which, whilst civil in
nature, might be no more palatable than those applying under the criminal model.
Relevant civil actions would include use of debt collection agencies, followed by
registration of a county court judgment, with the attendant implications for
individuals’ credit ratings and, where needed, enforcement of judgements using
instruments such as bailiffs. Given the larger number of households likely to receive
penalties under a civil model, these powers might also need to be used more widely
than the parallel powers operating under the current criminal model.

24

7.24 Finally, the BBC would be concerned about the potential conflict of interest
inherent in a system whereby the BBC was collecting evidence, determining
whether or not a penalty should be applied and pursuing civil action, including if
necessary through county courts. Such a potential conflict could be resolved by an
independent appeals process, or, if provided for by legislation, an independent
tribunal, but this would have a cost implication. By contrast the current system has
a well-defined and natural separation of roles: TV Licensing presents the evidence
to the courts which then determine the outcome.
Summary of the advantages and disadvantages of civil enforcement models
7.25 The research suggests that decriminalising the offence to evade the licence fee runs
a serious risk of increasing evasion and collection costs, with the consequent
significant loss of revenue for public service broadcasting. The effective bundle of
criminal deterrents would be lost and the sole effective deterrent would be the fine,
which would need to increase significantly to keep evasion down to current levels.
7.26 From a proportionality perspective, a civil infraction may, on the face of it, seem
more appropriate for the offence than a criminal sanction. This, however, gives only
a partial view of the real picture. The practical operation of the current system is
designed deliberately to keep first time offenders out of court, and then once in
court affords magistrates considerable freedom of action to tailor the fine and costs
according to circumstance, a feature unlikely to be available under a civil regime.

8

Alternative criminal enforcement systems: out of
court settlement (option 3) and fixed monetary
penalty (option 4)
Out of court settlement and fixed monetary penalty– Value for money

8.1

Under option 3 the criminal offence would be retained, with an option for disposal
by way of an out of court settlement. Under such a scheme - akin to the way the
DVLA operates and the current licence fee enforcement system in Scotland - the
prosecuting authority may in certain circumstances offer individuals an opportunity
to settle the matter without going to court. If the individual chooses not to accept
the offer, the case will then proceed through the court system as now. Under
option 4 the criminal offence would also be retained, with an option for disposal by
way of a fixed monetary penalty. Such a penalty would not be a fine or criminal
conviction, but a civil penalty to enforce the criminal offence. Prosecution through
the magistrates’ court would enforce non-acceptance or non-payment.

8.2

Taking the current system in Scotland as a relevant illustration of an out of court
settlement scheme, in March 2014 evasion in England was 5.2% whereas in Scotland
it was 7.3%65. Whilst evasion across the UK has been declining over a long period,

8.3

The differences in the rates of change in evasion between the jurisdictions cannot
be explained by the rate of enforcement activity carried out by TV Licensing in the
different nations.

8.4

Under option 4, the fixed monetary penalty, the likely impact on evasion is more
problematic than the out-of-court settlement, especially if it allows for a reduced or
waived penalty in the event of a licence being purchased, thereby offering a lesser
deterrent.

8.5

Under both these options, the level of the out-of-court settlement or fixed penalty
would need to be significantly higher than the licence fee (currently £145.50) in
order to act as a deterrent. It has to be questioned whether these options would
be able to balance the differing objectives of suitable deterrence with
proportionality. Without a suitable deterrent, there is a significant likelihood of
increased evasion and resulting loss of licence fee income.

8.6

Similarly, under both these options, the defendant has the opportunity to decline
either the proposed out-of-court settlement fine or the fixed penalty notice and
proceed to a hearing at the magistrates’ court. While out-of-court settlements are
widely accepted within Scotland as the fine rates tend to be low, it is not clear that
these options would necessarily reduce the burden on the courts. A fine or penalty
set at a level sufficient to create a deterrent is likely to increase the probability that
a case is pursued through the magistrates’ court – whether by the defendant
seeking a lower penalty which takes financial circumstances into account or by TV
Licensing for non-payment of the fine or penalty. A lower fine or penalty is likely to
reduce the probability of a case ending with magistrates but will likely increase
evasion.

8.7

The Scottish system may be regarded as more efficient than a hearing at a
magistrates’ court as the fine is decided on the papers by a single Procurator Fiscal.
In practice, however, few people actually attend court elsewhere in the UK, and, as
we have seen, cases are dealt with quickly consuming limited court time. Moreover,
the introduction of the Single Justice Procedure in England & Wales will achieve a
26

similar level of efficiency – the outcome of a case will be decided also on the papers
by a single justice.
Out-of-court settlement and fixed monetary penalty – Fairness and
proportionality
8.8

In contrast to the current system where prosecutions against first time offenders
are dropped if a licence is bought prior to hearing, all offenders would be treated
the same under these options.
Out-of-court settlement

8.9

If the out of court settlement is to be a sufficient deterrent then it could increase
the financial burden on lower income households due to the level of penalty
necessary and because there is only a very limited amount of time (28 days) to pay
these by instalments.

8.10 To introduce an out of court settlement in the rest of the UK would also
necessitate the introduction of the additional structure of a Scottish Prosecutor
Fiscal type regime, together with a new fine structure. The DVLA is empowered to
administer the out of court settlement procedure itself, and the BBC might be the
obvious candidate as the authority for licence fee offences. However, the BBC
would have reservations about assuming such a role as this requires the BBC to
collect the evidence of an offence, determine the sufficiency of the evidence, and set
the penalty (offer of an out of court settlement or prosecution). This is balanced
only by the individual being able to accept or decline the out of court settlement or
penalty and always having the right to have the court decide their case.
Fixed monetary penalty
8.11 The evidential test to issue a fixed penalty notice must meet the criminal standard
of ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. The resources involved in obtaining such evidence
will remain a high barrier and could be viewed as a disincentive to the BBC to
pursue cases where the outcome could be a small penalty. As is the case for all of
the options for reform, any lessening of the deterrent needs to be balanced by an
equivalent reduction in the barriers to establishing licence fee evasion.
8.12 Also, more people may be given a fixed penalty notice than are currently
prosecuted; whilst we would retain discretion as to how first time offenders were
treated, how that discretion was exercised in practice would depend on how
effective the system proved to be as a deterrent. As with the out-of-court
settlement, being a fixed rate fine it would likely increase the financial burden on
lower income households.
8.13 BBC collection costs are also likely to be higher under the alternatives. It is not
clear that enforcement costs would be recoverable through the penalty process in
any of the alternative models. An individual to whom a fixed penalty notice has
been issued is much less likely to pay it if they know that not paying no longer
27

carries with it criminal sanctions, and there is a reasonable chance that the BBC will
have insufficient evidence to meet the high criminal standard of proof at court.
Summary of the advantages and disadvantages of alternative criminal
enforcement models
8.14 A de facto out of court settlement system, whereby the majority of first time
offenders are able to avoid prosecution if they purchase a licence prior to hearing,
is already in operation within the current framework. The introduction of the
Single Justice Procedure will provide for cases in England and Wales to be
considered on the papers by a single justice, analogous to the approach in Scotland
by the Procurator Fiscal, but without its disadvantages. In Scotland, fewer people go
to court but as many are fined (in proportion to the population) and, whilst the fine
is lower, evasion is far higher.
8.15 For option 4, the fixed penalty notice would need to be sufficiently high to
constituent a deterrent but there would be a reduction in the opportunity to
operate discretion with the likely impact a more disproportionate penalty for first
time offenders and those on limited incomes.
8.16 Without making any change to the prosecution structure (say, on the lines of the
Procurator Fiscal in Scotland), it is our judgment that the public interest assessment
combined with the prospect of the new Single Justice Procedure to minimise further
court time and obviate the need for defendants to appear in court, will increasingly
constitute a de facto out of court settlement system. Critically, the current system
can deliver the benefits of an out of court settlement system without undermining
the deterrent effect.

Reform of the current system (option 2)

9.1

As argued in section 3, the BBC’s view is that the current arrangements for the
collection of the licence fee are efficient, appropriate and proportionate.

9.2

However, we also acknowledge the criticisms that have been levelled against the
current system and have welcomed this opportunity to consider how best to
address these. We are keen to consider reforms which will improve proportionality
and fairness whilst maintaining value for money in the public interest.

9.3

An important constraint in the context of any possible reforms to the current
enforcement system is the particular challenges that attend enforcing payment for
TV services. These challenges include the fact that:


The BBC cannot stop people who do not pay the licence fee from using the
BBC or other TV services66. It is therefore more vulnerable to payment

66

The TV licence covers watching or recording television programmes as they are broadcast, irrespective of
broadcaster.

28

evasion than suppliers who can disconnect non-payers, or certain utilities
which can install pre-payment meters. There are major practical and financial
considerations to gating BBC TV services. Although pay TV users have set top
boxes or other equipment with conditional access modules67, pay TV
equipment is only in just over 50%68 of households. Around 11.5m69
households have free-to-air TV alone, while a total of almost 20m70 households
have at least one ‘free’ TV set. This equipment would have to be fitted with
conditional access modules or replaced, at an estimated cost of around
£500m71.


To prove use of a device to watch or record TV as it is broadcast, TV
Licensing must present evidence on the conduct of households and business
carried out behind closed doors. This is in contrast to the evidence required
to establish criminal or civil offences, such as parking infractions or public
order offences, which, if they are committed, take place in public allowing for
easier assessment and detection. In addition, unlike vehicle offences which
often invalidate vehicle insurance, thus providing a strong disincentive for
members of the public to break the law, TV licensing offences carry no further
consequences for the individual except that provided by TV Licensing.



Although a licence is needed to view TV services as they are broadcast
regardless of the type of device used, the nature of the expanding range of
devices that can be used to view TV services as they are broadcast makes
proof of the offence increasingly difficult.

Reforms to the current model – Fairness and proportionality
9.4

Notwithstanding these wider challenges to the existing enforcement regime, the
BBC acknowledges that the current system could be improved to keep evasion low
while improving fairness, transparency, and proportionality. The BBC would like to
propose to the Perry Review a number of targeted reforms for consideration.

9.5

TV Licensing’s current application of the public interest test when considering
prosecution already amounts to a de facto out of court settlement system as
described in Option 3, but without the necessity to create a separate Procurator
Fiscal structure along the lines of that which operates in Scotland. It encourages
compliance with the law whilst diverting cases out of the courts.

9.6

To increase the perceived fairness and proportionality of the current regime, the
application of this public interest test could be formalised and made more
transparent. For example, TV Licensing could publish a code which would set out
67

This is equipment that (by a variety of technical means) ensures that only subscribers etc. can access pay TV
services.

the steps it will take before prosecuting, and the considerations it will apply in
deciding whether it is in the public interest to bring a prosecution.
9.7

Unlike the situation currently where visiting officers are not authorised to advise
the alleged offender on what the next steps would be, as the public interest test is
applied by TV Licensing centrally, this code could be made available on the doorstep
to make it clear how further action could be avoided (e.g. by becoming licensed if
they are a first time offender), rather than by letter following the visit as currently
happens.

9.8

We recognise that, in some circumstances, a first time offender may wish to make a
commitment to buy a licence and thereby avoid a court appearance but that the
payment schemes that TV Licensing is able to offer are not suitable for them. The
requirements of the instalment schemes as set out in the Regulations72 mean that
the first year’s licence must be paid for within a maximum of 6 months, creating a
barrier to payment for some households. Evasion can also occur where people
with licences have failed to pay for them and so had their licences cancelled. The
BBC would like to see increased flexibility in the instalment schemes to allow TV
Licensing to adapt payment plans to suit the individual and help them to stay
licensed.
Reforms to the current model – Value for money

9.9

If this code is to make it clear that in most cases prosecution will not follow if a
licence is purchased promptly after evidence is collected of evasion, the effect of
this on evasion must be considered and addressed.

9.10 Currently if a household is unlicensed TV Licensing may have no record as to
whether the household is occupied or the names of the occupiers. Correspondence
to households with unnamed individuals has a poorer response rate.
9.11 If the BBC were to have access to improved sources of data, such as electoral roll
or council tax databases, TV Licensing would be more confident of determining
which households are potentially licensable and who is the responsible person.
Access to sources of data linking names to addresses would enable TV Licensing
72

The Communications Act 2003 Section 365(1) provides that payments must be set out in Communications
(Television Licensing) Regulations 2004.).Thus, the regulations for instalment schemes must specify the precise
amount of every instalment, with no discretion for TV Licensing to vary the operation of the scheme.

30

better to reach the responsible person in unlicensed households.
9.12 In summary, the BBC proposes for consideration:
a) Codifying TV Licensing’s public interest assessment to increase transparency and
to make clear to defendants what they need to do to avoid a prosecution;
b) Increasing accessibility of the instalment payment schemes to reduce barriers to
payment; and
c) Providing the means to reach the responsible person in unlicensed households

more easily.
9.13 The BBC believes that these reforms would improve the fairness of the current
system without weakening significantly its deterrent effect.
