GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE CULTURE,
MEDIA AND SPORT SELECT COMMITTEE REPORT
ON HARMFUL CONTENT ON THE INTERNET AND
IN VIDEO GAMES
The Government thanks the Committee for its report on content on the internet and in video games.
We believe that this is a hugely important area and one that beneﬁts enormously from this type of
Parliamentary scrutiny, as it serves to air issues of concern.
The Government supports the general thrust of the Committee’s report and its many useful and
practical recommendations. These are issues we take extremely seriously and on which a great
deal of work is already underway. The technology is moving quickly and it represents a signiﬁcant
challenge to set up mechanisms to respond to technological innovations. However, we believe that
the mechanisms now emerging as a result of Dr Byron’s work suggest an appropriate way forward.
Many of the Committee’s recommendations fall within the remit of the UK Council for Child
Internet Safety (UKCCIS), a body set up under the aegis of Dr Byron’s review. We anticipate that
the Council will be working in many of the areas recommended by the Committee, but it is for the
Council to determine its own priorities. For this reason, it has not always been possible for us to
provide, at this stage, a detailed reply to some of the Committee’s recommendations.
We set out our response recommendation by recommendation below:
1. We agree that any approach to the protection of children from online dangers should
be based on the probability of risk. We believe that incontrovertible evidence of harm is not
necessarily required in order to justify a restriction of access to certain types of content in
any medium.
We welcome the Committee’s recommendation. In developing policies to protect children
from online dangers, the Government will take steps to ensure that any new measures will
be proportionate and risk-based, taking into account available evidence. The use of Impact
Assessments will help policy makers think through and understand the consequences of
any interventions, therefore enabling the Government to identify which proposals will
effectively protect children, while minimising costs and administrative burdens.
2. It is sensible that parents set boundaries for their children’s online activities, but a
totally risk-averse culture in parenting will not equip children to face dangers which they will
inevitably encounter as they grow older.
We agree with the Committee and believe that it is essential to strike the right balance in
order to manage the risks associated with online activities whilst not unduly restricting
children’s access to the internet. As Dr Byron highlighted in her report (Safer Children in
a Digital World), “risk taking is a developmental imperative of childhood”.
The Government, through the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) launched
by the Prime Minister on 29th September will consider how best to empower adults and
children to make informed decisions. This may include:

s

developing adults’ skills so that they feel conﬁdent about having conversations with
children about online safety;

s

providing parents with advice on how to take technical steps to manage online risks on
behalf of their children, which are appropriate to their age and competence;

1

s

encouraging more clarity in signalling potentially harmful material, helping parents to
decide what is appropriate;

s

empowering children to develop their own skills and awareness by providing supporting
tools and through better education awareness initiatives.

3. The Home Ofﬁce Task Force on Child Internet Safety has, by common consent, done
good work and has served its purpose well; but its loose funding and support structures have
given the impression that its work is of a comparatively low priority. We agree with Dr Byron
that the structure and funding of the Task Force should be formalised. We also welcome the
announcement by the Government that the date for establishment of the Council is to be
brought forward from April 2009 to September 2008. However, we are concerned at reports
from some key players that there has been no contact with Government to take this forward
and from others that there has been little opportunity to inﬂuence decisions as to how the
Council will operate in practice. We expect the Government to address these issues urgently.
The Government welcomes the recognition by the Committee and many witnesses of the
good work done by the Home Ofﬁce Task Force.
The new Council will build on that work and we have sought to engage future members
and other stakeholders fully in developing the design, structure and practices of the
Council. At the time of the Committee’s Inquiry, the government’s engagement strategy
with stakeholders was just getting underway.
The Council’s cross-departmental secretariat has since carried out an extensive process
of engagement with all sectors with an interest in internet child safety including industry,
the third sector, academics and law enforcement. This has been in addition to discussions
between departments and the devolved administrations.
We have held a number of roundtable meetings with Council members seeking their views
on governance, decision making, resources and other operational issues. These discussions
have already led to over 100 organisations accepting an invitation to join the Council.
The full list of Council members and its Executive Board is attached as an annex to this
paper. Membership was announced when the Prime Minister launched the Council on
29th September.
The government is committed to ensuring that the Council is a collaborative forum enabling
Government Departments and all relevant stakeholders to come together and contribute
jointly to the development and delivery of the Child internet Safety Strategy. This will
build on the open, inclusive way in which Dr Byron’s Review was conducted.
4. We agree that the Council, at least in its early years, should be chaired by a Minister, to
ensure that Council members have direct access to public policy-making. However, we question
the proposed joint chairing arrangement, which excludes DCMS Ministers. We believe that it
would be unfortunate if DCMS were to appear subsidiary in Council governance, given its role
in media regulation, although we recognise the practical difﬁculties in sharing the chairing role
between many Departments: indeed, we question whether co-chairing is desirable in principle.
We invite the Government to consider carefully whether to appoint a single lead minister,
either from one of the Departments represented or perhaps from the Cabinet Ofﬁce. There
may be a case in future for the Council to be chaired by someone who sits outside Government,
particularly if the role of the Council is to expand. Given that the Government has accepted Dr
Byron’s recommendations in full, we believe it should now move quickly to provide a budget.

2

We note the Committee’s comments about the chairing arrangements for the Council. We
carefully considered the practicalities of this issue, and the recommendation for joint chairs
by Dr Byron, when scoping the governance of the Council and concluded that:

s

As Dr Byron identiﬁed, a single chair would not be appropriate as responsibility for this
policy area rests with more than one department.

s

It is appropriate for the chairs to be at ministerial level given the importance of the work
and the need to engage fully with stakeholders.

s

More than two co-chairs would present unnecessary operational difﬁculties with no
obvious beneﬁts.

s

Ministerial representation on the Council as a whole should be from the three departments
responsible for delivery of the Byron Review recommendations – DSCF, DCMS and the
Home Ofﬁce.
DCMS will continue to play a key role in the work of the Council and the delivery of Dr
Byron’s recommendations.
Ofﬁcials from DCSF, DCMS and the Home Ofﬁce are currently in discussion to agree a
budget for the work of the Council and the secretariat

5. While there might be an expectation that most of the Council’s effort would be directed
towards child protection, we believe that there is a danger of overlooking possible harm
to vulnerable adults, and we recommend that the Government should give this proper
consideration when deciding the Council’s terms of reference.
We note the Committee’s concerns but the Council’s remit is clear – to take responsibility
for developing and overseeing the implementation of a Child Internet Safety Strategy with
two core elements:

s

Better regulation – in the form, wherever possible, of voluntary codes of practice that
industry can sign up to

s

Better information and education for children and parents – where the role of government,
law enforcement, schools and children’s services will be key
Much of the Council’s work could have beneﬁcial effects for all internet users – for example,
increased recognition of, and compliance with, Acceptable Use Policies that explain to
website users what they are permitted, and not permitted, to do. However, any substantial
change to its remit could deﬂect the Council from its core purpose of promoting child
safety.
The government has also set up the Convergence Think Tank (CTT) to consider the future
of communications regulation and policy. How to make the online environment safer for
consumers of all ages is an important question being considered by the CTT. Potential
harmful or offensive content is one part of this, and it is likely that better regulation, public
information and education will play an important role, as they have in the Byron Review
Action Plan. The CTT is due to deliver a ﬁnal report in early 2009.
In the near term, there are some initiatives already in place. For example, implementation
of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive is currently being consulted on: this will
extend some of the protections we currently have for broadcast television content to some
on-demand services delivered online. And a new internet safety training module is being
developed to be delivered through UK Online Centres. This will be appropriate for, and
freely available to, children and adults alike.

3

6. We are much impressed by the work of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection
Centre and its close co-operation with charities such as the National Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children. However, we are concerned that levels of funding are not keeping
pace with the increasing volume of work which is referred to the Centre, and we therefore
encourage the Government to look favourably on any request by CEOP for increased
resources. We also welcome the ﬁnancial contribution made by charities and industry, and
we believe that the latter should be increased: business models for Internet-based services
rely upon public conﬁdence that networking sites are safe to use, and CEOP plays a large
part in delivering that safety.
The Government has indicated that it will consider requests for resources, with the caveat
that these requests need to be considered as part of the overall Home Ofﬁce budget
discussions.
The Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP) receives an annual budget from
the Home Ofﬁce, which is paid through the Serious Organised Crime Agency to which
it is afﬁliated. In addition to the Home Ofﬁce grant, CEOP receives signiﬁcant levels of
support from industry and the third sector.
In 2008-09 CEOP received an annual budget (from the Home Ofﬁce) of £5.77 million and
an annual budget of £5.657 million 2007-08 and of £5.110 million in 2006-07.
The Government is pleased by the level of support industry, charities and other sources
have shown to CEOP and encourages them to continue supporting CEOP in its excellent
work.
7. We strongly recommend that terms and conditions which guide consumers on the types of
content which are acceptable on a site should be prominent. It should be made more difﬁcult
for users to avoid seeing and reading the conditions of use: as a consequence, it would become
more difﬁcult for users to claim ignorance of terms and conditions if they upload inappropriate
content. The UK Council for Child Internet Safety should examine this at an early stage and
produce recommendations as to how it is best achieved.
We note the Committee’s recommendation. At an early stage after launch, the Council will
need to consider the priority to be given to this important issue.
The work of the Council will build on the Home Secretary’s Taskforce on Child Protection
on the internet that has already published a number of good practice guidelines to
support industry in their design and moderation of chat rooms and instant messaging
(2003), interactive services for children (2005) and social networking sites (2008). These
guidelines set out practical steps that companies can take to help users use their websites
safely and responsibly, and promote the communication of acceptable behaviour at the
point of registration.
8. We are also concerned that user-generated video content on sites such as YouTube does
not carry any age classiﬁcation, nor is there a watershed before which it cannot be viewed.
We welcome efforts by YouTube to identify material only suitable for adults, such as that
containing foul language, and to develop potential controls to prevent children from accessing
it.
See the response to questions 10, 11, 12 and 13
9. We do not believe that it is in the public interest for Internet service providers or
networking sites to neglect screening content because of a fear that they will become liable
under the terms of the EC E-Commerce Directive for material which is illegal but which is not
identiﬁed. It would be perverse if the law were to make such sites more vulnerable for trying

4

to offer protection to consumers. We recommend that Ofcom or the Government should set
out their interpretation of when the E-Commerce Directive will place upon Internet service
providers liability for content which they host or to which they enable access. Ultimately, the
Government should be prepared to seek amendment to the Directive if it is preventing ISPs
and websites from exercising more rigorous controls over content.
We agree with the Committee that it is not desirable for ISPs and networking sites to
refrain from scrutiny of content due to fears regarding the e-commerce Directive. We do
not believe that the e-commerce Directive was designed to have this effect, and we believe
that the UK’s implementation is in line with the original intention.
In certain circumstances, ISPs can be required to take action to terminate or prevent speciﬁc
infringements (e.g. monitoring/screening speciﬁc accounts for a speciﬁed time or ﬁltering
speciﬁc content). The e-commerce Directive, however, prevents the imposition of general
monitoring requirements on ISPs, or the imposition of general obligations to seek actively
the facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity.
The Government will work with the industry and other stakeholders to understand and
address any legal issues in this area. We will also continue to engage with the European
Commission and other Member States on this and other related issues with regards to a
possible review of the e-Commerce Directive in 2009.
10. We found the arguments put forward by Google/You Tube against their staff undertaking
any kind of proactive screening to be unconvincing. To plead that the volume of trafﬁc prevents
screening of content is clearly not correct: indeed, major providers such as MySpace have
not been deterred from reviewing material posted on their sites. Even if review of every bit
of content is not practical, that is not an argument to undertake none at all. We recommend
that proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated
content, and we look to the UK Council proposed by Dr Byron to give a high priority to
reconciling the conﬂicting claims about the practicality and effectiveness of using staff and
technological tools to screen and take down material.
11. File titles and screening tools can help to identify ﬁles which appear to present a particular
risk of exposure to inappropriate material. We encourage sites which handle user-generated
content to develop as a priority technological tools to screen ﬁle titles and prevent the upload
of – or quarantine – material which potentially violates terms and conditions of use until it
has been reviewed by staff. We also encourage sites to share their knowledge and expertise at
the UK Council on Child Internet Safety, with a view to developing codes of practice for prior
screening of material.
12. We ﬁnd it shocking that a take-down time of 24 hours for removal of child abuse content
should be an industry standard.
13. We believe that there is a need for agreed minimum standards across industry on takedown times in order to increase consumer conﬁdence. We recommend that the UK Council
on Child Internet Safety should work with Internet-based industries to develop a consistent
and transparent policy on take-down procedures with clear maximum times within which
inappropriate material will be removed. This should be subject to independent veriﬁcation
and publication.
We agree with the Committee that the enormous growth in user generated content has
highlighted the importance of effective screening and other measures to prevent, where
possible, the display of inappropriate content to children.

5

The Government is committed to working with the Council on Dr Byron’s recommendation
to develop an independently monitored voluntary code of practice on the moderation of
user generated content. As part of this process, the Government anticipates that the Council
will consider the issues raised by the Committee.
Dr Byron has made several other recommendations, in relation to child safety and user
generated content that will provide a safer environment for children and adults alike.
These have been accepted by the Government, and will be considered in due course by the
Council. These include:

s
s

Encouraging websites to sign up to public commitments on “take-down” times

s
s

Ensuring safety information is displayed in prominent places

s
s

Raising children’s and parents’ awareness of their role in reporting abuse to the site’s host

Encouraging search providers to make it obvious to users what level of search is on (e.g.
safe or moderate) and give users the option to ‘lock it’ on

Ensuring search engines have a clear link to child safety information and safe search
settings on the front page of their website

Developing ways for parental control software to communicate automatically with
websites’ age-veriﬁcation systems to prevent children from signing up to sites with false
dates of birth.

14. We await the announcement by the Ministry of Justice on whether the law might be
strengthened to help prevent the use of the Internet to encourage suicide. Even if it concludes
that the offence of assisting suicide is clear enough in law to enable successful prosecutions
of those responsible for websites which assist or encourage suicide, we believe that the law
should not be the only means of controlling access. The characteristics of the offence should be
clear enough in law to enable access to such sites to be blocked on a voluntary basis, possibly
through the procedures established by the Internet Watch Foundation. The UK Council for
Child Internet Safety should accord a high priority in its work programme to discussions
with the Ministry of Justice on whether the law on assisted suicide is worded clearly enough
to include websites which encourage suicide and to enable action to be taken to block access to
websites which assist or encourage suicide.
Justice Minister Maria Eagle announced on 17 September that the law on assisting suicide
is to be simpliﬁed to increase public understanding and reassure people that it applies as
much on the internet as it does off-line.
This demonstrates the Government’s commitment to implementing Dr Byron’s
recommendation in this area. The UK Council will consider the practicalities of restricting
access to websites that are not in accordance with UK law and how enforcement mechanisms
can and should be applied to online activity.
15. At a time of rapid technological change, it is difﬁcult to judge whether blocking access to
Internet content at network level by Internet service providers is likely to become ineffective
in the near future. However, this is not a reason for not doing so while it is still effective for the
overwhelming majority of users.
The Government is committed to encouraging all UK ISPs offering domestic broadband
services, to block access to child abuse images online. We note the Committee’s
recommendation and agree that this method should be kept under review in light of rapid
technological changes.

6

16. We believe that there would be advantage in establishing a forum at which governments
or regulators from across the world could try to ﬁnd common ground on how access to content
on the Internet should be treated. This may, in time, lead to a more co-ordinated effort in
frustrating access to material which is widely perceived as harmful. We recommend that the
Government should take a lead in establishing such a forum.
We concur with the Committee on the importance of discussion among countries on trying
to limit access to harmful content. We need, however, to distinguish between content which
is generally considered illegal, where there are already mechanisms for international
dialogue (such in the Internet Governance Forum) and potentially harmful content where
there is less international coordination (not least because of the difﬁculty in agreeing what
is harmful). Work has, however, been taken forward in the Council of Europe on harmful
content (especially in relation to children) which the UK has been involved with.
17. It is clear that many users of social networking sites, particularly children, do not realise
that by posting information about themselves, they may be making it publicly available for all
to see. We recommend that social networking sites should have a default setting restricting
access and that users should be required to take a deliberate decision to make their personal
information more widely available. We also recommend that consideration be given to alerting
users through pop-up displays about the risks involved in submitting personal details without
restricting access.
It should be recognised that children join social networks in order for their proﬁles to be
seen by other children but it is also clear that many do not realise how the different privacy
settings work and that they may inadvertently make their proﬁles public for everyone. The
recent HO Social Networking Guidance contains a number of recommendations to Service
Providers including the provision of better information for users to understand what the
different privacy settings mean, giving them a choice of ‘privacy or public’ options or
settings to use and providing advice to users about the implications of posting personal
data.
18. We commend Microsoft for providing a facility for direct reporting to the Child
Exploitation and Online Protection Centre within Windows Live Messenger. We believe
that high proﬁle one-click facilities for reporting directly to law enforcement and support
organisations are an essential feature of a safe networking site. We recommend that the UK
Council for Child Internet Safety should impress upon providers of networking services
the value of direct one-click reporting from their websites to law enforcement agencies and
voluntary sector organisations with expertise in offering support to vulnerable people. We
also believe that facilities for reporting abuse should be obvious to users and should be
directly accessible from all relevant pages of a website, close to the entry point. We would
expect providers of all Internet services based upon user participation to move towards
these standards without delay.
We note the Committee’s recommendations and agree that providing a mechanism for
reporting inappropriate content would be a valuable tool for children and parents alike.
How this can be achieved consistently across the internet and in a way that does not
overburden law enforcement agencies is a matter for the Council to consider.
The Government also welcomes the work that CEOP continues to do to tackle the sexual
abuse and exploitation of children, and is pleased that CEOP will be represented on the
Council and its Executive Board
19. We recommend that network operators and manufacturers of mobile devices should
assess whether it is technically possible to enable images sent from mobile devices to be traced
and viewed by law enforcement ofﬁcers with the appropriate authority.

7

Monitoring of content transmitted over phone networks has serious implications in terms
of civil liberties, and in general would not be permitted under EU law. The Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act already set out the circumstances under which this is permitted.
It is also possible for forensic experts to recover images – often including those which have
been deleted – from a mobile phone handset, in the same way that they can recover emails
from computers
The Government supports the Committee’s recommendation that network operators should
assess whether it is technically possible to enable images posted online to be linked with
the devices used to upload them when required to do so by law enforcement ofﬁcers with
the appropriate authority.
20. We commend Microsoft for their efforts to ensure that there are varied and effective
parental controls built in to their hardware. We believe that other console manufacturers
should be encouraged at least to match these. We hope that this matter will also be considered
at an early date by the UK Council on Child Internet Safety.
We note the Committee’s recommendation. At an early stage after launch, the Council will
need to consider where this issue should ﬁgure in its priorities.
The Government has accepted Dr Byron’s recommendation to look at establishing a kite
mark for parental controls to provide recognisable consistency for parents. This will ensure
that computers sold for use in the home in the UK have preloaded kite marked parental
control software that takes parents through clear prompts and explanations to help set it up,
and that internet service providers offer and advertise this prominently when users set up
their connection. The Government will work with the Council and other partners to deliver
Dr Byron’s recommendation.
21. We expect the Government to apply continuing, and if necessary, escalating pressure on
Internet service providers who are showing reluctance to block access to illegal content hosted
abroad. In a lucrative market, the cost to Internet service providers of installing software to
block access to child pornography sites should not come second to child safety.
The Government is committed to working with the Internet Watch Foundation and the
internet industry to reach the target set by Ministers of 100% of UK ISPs (providing
domestic broadband connections) blocking access to websites containing child abuse
images
Whilst, as explained in the context of recommendation 9, it would be permissible under
the e-commerce Directive to require internet intermediaries to carry out a certain degree of
ﬁltering/blocking, any speciﬁc proposals would need to be assessed for their compatibility
with the prohibition in Article 15 of the e-commerce Directive to impose general monitoring
requirements on ISPs.
22. We believe that leaving individual companies in the Internet services sector to regulate
themselves in the protection of users from potential harm has resulted in a piecemeal
approach which we ﬁnd unsatisfactory. Different practices are being followed and there is
a lack of consistency and transparency, leading to confusion among users. Nor is there any
external mechanism for complaints about services provided by Internet-based industries to
be considered by an independent body. However, we do not believe that statutory regulation
should be the ﬁrst resort. Instead, we propose a tighter form of self-regulation, applied across
the industry and led by the industry. We therefore call on the industry to establish a selfregulatory body which would agree minimum standards based upon the recommendations of
the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, monitor their effectiveness, publish performance
statistics and adjudicate on complaints.
See response to recommendation 24.
8

23. We recognise that a number of companies may choose to set higher standards for their
own commercial reasons, but the public need the assurance that certain basic standards will
be met. This is particularly important in the area of child protection and Internet safety.
However, the new body might also take on the task of setting rules governing practice in other
areas such as on-line piracy and peer to peer ﬁle-sharing, and behavioural advertising, which
although outside the scope of this inquiry are also of public concern. Given the global nature
of the industry, it is impossible to make membership compulsory for all service providers,
but a widespread publicity campaign should ensure that consumers are aware that they can
have conﬁdence in the standards of protection and reputable practice which membership of
the body carries with it and that this cannot be guaranteed by those companies that choose
not to join.
We can see that there may be merit in considering in due course whether self regulatory
arrangements set up under the auspices of UKCCIS should also cover other consumer
protection issues. However, it is important to distinguish between issues that relate to
consumer protection and those, such as piracy, that are principally about relationships
between different parts of industry. The Government has recently published a consultation
on suggested approaches to peer to peer ﬁle sharing, which outlines a possible industry
led approach. However, this would require different structures, involve different parts
of industry from those foreseen under UKCCIS and would need to be underpinned
by regulation.
24. Our preferred model for any new body to maintain standards among providers of Internetbased services is that of the Advertising Standards Authority, which is generally successful at
securing compliance with codes for advertising standards but which, if necessary, may refer
companies which persistently breach those standards to statutory regulators that can apply
penalties.
We agree with the Committee’s view that statutory regulation in this area should not be
a ﬁrst resort and that industry self regulation based on agreed standards is the preferred
way forward.
As part of her Review, Dr Byron stated that a priority focus of the Child Internet Safety
Strategy should be to work with industry to develop a better regulatory framework,
including independently monitored self-regulatory codes that will build on best practice,
promote transparency and provide families with the tools and reassurance they need to use
the internet safely. The Child Internet Safety Strategy will be developed by the Council
and published in spring 2009.
Given the global nature of the internet beyond national boundaries Dr Byron recommended
a self-regulatory system for protecting children from potentially harmful or inappropriate
material. However, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a parallel example in another area of industry
self-regulation to help deﬁne this approach to e-safety, not least because the internet is
constantly evolving in how it is used and what it can offer. We therefore need an innovative,
ﬂexible approach that provides the appropriate levels of challenge and support to all
stakeholders.
A part of this ﬂexible approach could be the establishment of an industry self-regulatory
body but that would be a matter for industry to consider with Council partners as part of
their wider discussions on self regulation.
25. We commend the Government for the action it has taken to motivate the Internet industry,
the voluntary sector and others to work together to improve the level of protection from risks
from the Internet, particularly for children. However, we regret that much of this work remains
unknown and has therefore done little to increase public conﬁdence. We look to the UK Council
to build on the existing agreements and to ensure a much greater public awareness of what has
already been achieved.
9

We are grateful for the Committee’s comments and do recognise the beneﬁts of publicising
both the importance of internet safety to families and the sources of available help. The
Committee’s report has drawn welcome attention to a number of the initiatives we have
put in place and which have had a signiﬁcant impact – the distribution of over one million
Know IT All CDs being a good example.
The Government is already committed to delivering a £9m communications campaign on
child safety over the next three years, as set out in the Staying Safe Action Plan published
in February 2008. The Byron Review recommendations on public information will be
taken forward as part of that commitment.
We look forward to working with the Council to co-ordinate our efforts and reach children
and parents in a variety of ways.
26. We also note that the Government originally suggested that four different Ministers should
give evidence to our inquiry and it does seem that there is scope for improved co-ordination
of activity between different Government departments. We recommend that a single Minister
should have responsibility for co-ordinating the Government’s effort in improving levels of
protection from harm from the Internet, overseeing complementary initiatives led by different
Government departments, and monitoring the resourcing of relevant Government-funded
bodies.
The Government recognises that there needs to be close cooperation. The UK Council for
Child Internet Safety will, of course, be a key forum for engagement, but this will need to
form part of a coherent strategy to ensure that we can balance public policy imperatives
with the need to allow these key industries to develop, innovate and ﬂourish. Ministerial
responsibilities are a matter for the Prime Minister who keeps them under review.
27. We endorse the thrust of Dr Byron’s recommendations on improving media literacy,
and we commend her for her approach. However, we believe that the one-stop shop will only
be worth locating on the DirectGov website if search tools, social networking sites, videosharing sites and Internet service providers offer a direct link: otherwise the one-stop shop
will languish in obscurity. We also recommend that all new computer equipment sold for home
use should be supplied with a standard information leaﬂet, to be agreed with the IT hardware
and software industries through the UK Council on Child Internet Safety, containing advice
for parents on Internet safety tools and practices.
We note the Committee’s recommendations on making effective links to a one-stop shop on
child internet safety and the provision of an information leaﬂet with purchased computer
hardware.
The Government agrees in principle with Dr Byron’s recommendation that an authoritative
one-stop shop for child internet safety is needed and this could be sited within the DirectGov
network. However, it is for the Council to consider the practicalities of doing so and the
links with the wider internet to ensure greater penetration of the right messages to parents
and their families.
The Government recognises the importance of accurate, relevant, concise, readable and
easily available information to all parents but the provision of internet safety material
with hardware is an issue for the Council to consider as part of the wider communications
strategy recommended by Dr Byron.

10

28. We agree with Ofcom that parents will need to take on greater responsibility for protecting
children from harm from the Internet and from video games. In particular, they should be
aware of the consequences of buying devices which allow unsupervised access to the Internet;
they should have more knowledge of young children’s social networking activities and be more
familiar with video game content, thereby gaining a better understanding of the risks; and
they should, wherever possible, discuss those risks openly with their children. We recommend
that the UK Council for Child Internet Safety should investigate ways of communicating these
messages to parents.
We agree with the Committee’s recommendations that managing a lot of the risks that
children face on the internet and video games will remain the responsibility of parents.
The Government has accepted Dr Byron’s recommendation to develop an information and
education strategy, focused on raising the knowledge, skills and understanding around
e-safety for children, parents and other responsible adults. We will work with the Council
to produce and deliver this strategy.
As identiﬁed in Dr Byron’s report, the strategy will need to address two speciﬁc areas:

s

The generational digital divide – this would mean addressing the very real needs of parents,
teachers and others involved in the care of children and young people in order to empower
them to address online safety issues with the children and young people in their care, so
that parenting and education that addresses issues of safety and wellbeing is understood as
being related to both the ofﬂine and the online worlds.

s

The needs of children and young people – this would mean providing appropriately targeted
information to enable children and young people themselves to develop their own online
safety awareness and skills.

29. We recognise the concerns that the hybrid system for games classiﬁcation proposed by Dr
Byron may not command conﬁdence in the games industry and would not provide signiﬁcantly
greater clarity for consumers. We believe that, ideally, a single classiﬁcation system should be
adopted. While either of the systems operated by the BBFC and by PEGI would be workable
in principle, we believe that the widespread recognition of the BBFC’s classiﬁcation categories
in the UK and their statutory backing offer signiﬁcant advantages which the PEGI system
lacks. We therefore agree that the BBFC should continue to rate games with adult content and
should have responsibility for rating games with content appropriate only for players aged
12 or above, and that these ratings should appear prominently. Online distributors should
be encouraged to take advantage of the BBFC.online scheme which should be promoted as
offering greater conﬁdence to parents about the nature of the game. While we hope that PEGI
will work with the BBFC to develop a single system, distributors are of course free to continue
to use PEGI ratings in addition, as they do at present.
The Committee will know that, in accordance with Dr Byron’s recommendations, a consultation on
the classiﬁcation of computer games was launched on 31 July. It will run until 20 November and we
welcome all responses. The four classiﬁcation options detailed in the consultation document are:
BBFC/PEGI (Pan-European Game Information) hybrid system
The BBFC would rate all games that are only suitable for players over the age of 12, with PEGI
continuing to rate all 3+ and 7+ games. The BBFC logos would appear on the front of all boxes,
with the PEGI logos on the back.
The BBFC would extend its statutory powers to cover games from 12+, bringing it into line with the
classiﬁcation system used for DVDs and videos and building on parental awareness and understanding
of what those ratings mean. For this to work best, the BBFC and PEGI would need to agree to
harmonise their logos and age classiﬁcations so there is no further potential for confusion.

11

Enhanced BBFC system
The BBFC would act as the sole statutory classiﬁcations body for all video games, applying its
ratings from U to 18. It would retain its power to refuse to classify games it feels are potentially
harmful based on its public consultations.
Enhanced PEGI system
A UK-based organisation (potentially the Video Standards Council) would be the designated
statutory classiﬁcation body for video games, applying the PEGI ratings. The VSC (or other UK
body chosen) would need to sign up to this new role and any other legislative duties required of it.
All video games would be rated using the PEGI system and the only role for the BBFC would be in
classifying ﬁlm content which is not integral to the game.
Voluntary Code of Practice
There would be no changes made to the legislation so BBFC and PEGI would continue to classify
games as they currently do. The current system of dual classiﬁcation and labelling would continue
to exist. The Government would then ask retailers and suppliers to sign up to a voluntary Code of
Practice to ensure that they adhered to the classiﬁcation system when supplying video games to
children aged 12 or above, even though a statutory offence would not be committed if they broke
the Code.
As Dr Bryon said, the ﬁnal system must have the following characteristics
– a uniform and clear set of symbols/labels to categorise the age ratings;
– the power to refuse to certify titles;
– a statutory basis to the video games classiﬁcations system from age 12 onwards;
– a non statutory system up to the age of 12;
– be ﬂexible and future proof;
– work for the games industry;
– support retailers; and
– reﬂect the evidence on potential harms.
We note the Committee’s views, and if they have further views on any of the options we
are now consulting on, we would be happy to hear them.
