Executive Summary
The constitutional basis of the BBC is the Royal Charter. This is due to expire at the
end of 2016. The BBC Charter Review Public Consultation sought to engage the UK
in a dialogue about the future of the BBC in four key areas:
● Why the BBC? Mission, purpose and values.
● What the BBC does: scale and scope.
● Funding.
● Governance and regulation.
The consultation asked 19 questions and the response was one of the largest ever
received to a government consultation, highlighting that the future of the BBC is an
important issue to a great many people. As well as a large public response, we also
received many in-depth responses from a range of key industry experts and
organisations, and other organisations with an interest in the future of the BBC.
Why the BBC? Mission, purpose and values
The great majority (95 per cent) did not express a view on this issue. Of those that
did, 3 per cent felt that no change was required to the BBC’s public purposes and 2
per cent said some change was needed. Many organisations that responded
supported the current approach of high-level public purposes together with morespecific purpose remits, but suggested they should be updated to make them
relevant for today and for the next decade.
On the concept of universality, many organisations were supportive of the idea that
everyone should be able to find something on the BBC for them, but that this was not
the same as the BBC providing everything.
There was no clear view on establishing a set of values.
What the BBC does: Scale and scope
The majority of responses indicated that BBC expansion was justified in the context
of increased choice for audiences. A number of organisations highlighted specific
areas of concern with regard to crowding out commercial competitors.
The majority of responses also indicated their view that the BBC had a positive wider
impact on the market, including raising broadcasting standards across the industry.
Negative market impacts referenced included the digital content sector, the radio
market and local news, in addition to the BBC’s impact on the commercial TV
broadcasters.
A number of organisations supported the view that the BBC has had a positive
impact on the development of broadcasting technology from which the whole
industry has benefited. However it was also noted by some respondents that the
BBC can also have a negative impact, particularly in areas where other organisations
were already operating. Overall, there were relatively few responses on this issue,
with the most popular view indicating the BBC should continue to play a leading role.

2

A majority of responses suggested that the BBC was serving its audiences well.
However, a number of groups were identified as less well served, including young
people, people from Black or other minority ethnic communities and those that are
less well off. The UK’s nations and regions were also acknowledged as areas where
improvement was needed.
Less than a quarter of those who responded to the consultation provided a view as to
whether the genre mix was right. Of those that did, most indicated that this mix was
mostly or generally right on the BBC. Many organisations believed that the BBC
should continue to commission a broad selection of programmes across the full
genre range, and some said that the BBC could go even further and improve its
programming mix on both TV and radio.
The majority of responses indicated that the BBC’s content was of high quality, and
distinctive from that of other broadcasters. Specific reforms were suggested that
could increase quality and distinctiveness, particularly of content across the
schedule, and specifically on the BBC’s most popular services.
Many organisations agreed there was a rationale for reviewing the regulatory
framework around the system of content production; however, overall there were
very few responses addressing this issue.
Funding
In terms of how we should pay for the BBC and whether the licence fee should
be modernised, three-fifths of the responses to the consultation indicated that no
change was needed to the current system.
However, 15 per cent indicated that there should be some form of licence fee reform,
such as closing the iPlayer “loophole”. The majority of organisations agreed that an
update of the licence fee was needed, due to changes in technology and in the
viewing behaviours of audiences.
The large majority (92 per cent) provided no view on protected funding. Of those that
did, a small number of responses indicated that funding for some services should be
protected, with a range of services suggested, including the BBC World Service.
Many organisations argued against the idea of protecting funding through ringfencing money for certain types of content or ‘top-slicing’ funds from the licence fee,
and believed that it should be up to the BBC to decide the relative funding of each of
its services.
The majority of responses suggested that the BBC has been doing enough to deliver
value for money, although many responses also said that the BBC must continue to
improve in this area.
A little more than 6 per cent of the consultation responses commented on whether
the BBC’s commercial operations, including BBC Worldwide, should be
reformed. In general there was a sense, from those organisations that thought they

3

were impacted by BBC Worldwide’s operations, that the current fair trading
arrangements need further clarity and improvement.
Governance and regulation
Around 85 per cent did not express a view on how current models of governance
and regulation for the BBC should be reformed. Just over 5 per cent indicated that a
standalone regulator was the most popular option, with Ofcom the second most
popular. Ofcom was the preferred choice of many organisations for this role.
Arguments were made in favour of the need for clear independent governance, and
accountability to licence fee payers and industry partners.
Only a very small proportion of responses (2 per cent) provided any views about how
public value tests and service licences should be reformed, and who should have
responsibility for making these decisions, with no clear view emerging from the public
responses. Most organisations were supportive of public value tests and service
licences as useful regulatory and governance mechanisms, but would like to see
some reform.
Of those that expressed a view (6 per cent), a majority felt the BBC could improve
engagement with licence fee payers and the industry, including through research,
transparency and the handling of complaints. A number of organisations noted that
the engagement of the BBC with organisations and audiences currently worked well,
but nevertheless called for improvements with regard to industry partnerships,
audience engagement, complaints handling and transparency.
A large majority of responses indicated that the BBC should remain independent
from one or more of government, Parliament and Ofcom. A number of
organisations argued for reform to provide greater accountability.
Only a very small proportion (2 per cent) of responses commented on whether the
BBC's existing framework of a 10-year Royal Charter and Framework Agreement
between the BBC and the Secretary of State should remain in place, with its
continuation being the most popular preference among those who offered a view.
Other views included taking Charter Review out of the electoral cycle and making
sure the Charter could adapt and reflect developments in the rapidly changing media
sector.

Introduction
Background
The BBC is established by Royal Charter. The current Charter, the eighth, sets out
the public purposes of the BBC and outlines the respective duties of the BBC Trust
and the Executive Board. It came into full effect on 1 January 2007 and expires on 31
December 2016. The government is responsible for reviewing, and seeking the
renewal of, the BBC’s Royal Charter.
The publication of the Charter Review Public Consultation launched the Charter
Review process. The consultation was open for 12 weeks from 16 July 2015 to 8
October 2015.
What we asked
The consultation asked 19 questions, covering:
● Mission, purpose and values – what the BBC is for, examining the overall
rationale for the BBC and the case for reform of its public purposes;
● Scale and scope – what the BBC therefore should do, examining the services
it should deliver and the audiences it should be seeking to serve;
● Funding – how the BBC should be paid for, examining not just future potential
funding models but related issues such as efficiency and value for money;
and
● Governance – how the BBC should be overseen, examining options for the
reform of the current Trust model alongside other matters of governance.
A list of consultation questions is at Annex A.
The responses
On closure of the consultation, the government had received over 192,000 emails,
letters and online survey responses. This does not include petition signatures. Over
64,000 responses were submitted in the final 48 hours of the consultation period.
192,564 Total number of emails, letters and online survey responses received by
closing date
This included:
7,666 Online survey responses
184,898 Emails and letters
Of which:
7,304 Duplicate responses, blank responses, and non-consultation responses such
as spam and general queries identified during the analysis process

A number of groups organised and encouraged responses to the consultation. In
particular, the social campaigning organisation 38 Degrees encouraged a large
number of its members to respond, reporting on their website that 177,000 of their
members wrote into the consultation, and this undoubtedly contributed to what was
one of the largest ever public consultations. We have not categorised responses in
any way other than how the responses were received, and all responses have been
treated equally.
The government does not intend to publish all of the consultation responses it
received. Many organisations who responded have independently published their
respective responses.
Other feedback
We also received other feedback to the consultation, including 8,500 responses to a
set of questions published in the Radio Times and a number of petitions, including:
● BacktheBBC: 10,333 signatures;
● Save BBC3: 303,246 signatures.
BBC consultations
In July 2015, the BBC Trust issued its initial response to the government’s
consultation document and launched its own public consultation, receiving over
40,000 responses. This was followed by the publication of ‘British, Bold, Creative’ by
the BBC Executive in September 2015, setting out plans for the BBC in the next
Charter period. The BBC Trust launched a second phase of BBC consultation
seeking views on the proposals set out in ‘British, Bold, Creative’, which attracted
over 11,000 responses. Towards the end of 2015, the Trust also ran a series of
public seminars which debated a range of issues. Further information can be found
here: www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/governance/charter_review.
This response
This document describes the views expressed in response to the questions
contained within the government’s consultation and is structured around the four
themes in the consultation document. Where quotes from individuals are used it is to
provide a view indicative of the statistical data.
The figures in this report refer to those that responded to the consultation. They
should not be treated as statistically representative of the public at large. All
percentages referenced in the report refer to the percentage of the valid responses
received for that question.
As set out in the consultation document, this mass public engagement is a central
part of the wider programme of evidence gathering for Charter Review. The
government has also undertaken and commissioned a range of further reviews,
studies and research; including qualitative focus groups and statistically
representative polling. The results of these studies will complement the evidence
provided by the responses to the public consultation – summarised in this document.
The government will publish its proposals for the future of the BBC in Spring 2016.

Chapter 1: Why the BBC? Mission, purpose and values
The first chapter of the public consultation explored what the significant changes in
the social, demographic and media landscape over the past decade means for the
role of the BBC in the future. The consultation considered:
● What the BBC is for, examining the case for reform of its six public purposes;
● The idea of ‘universality’ and if the BBC should focus on providing
programmes and services for all audiences, and on an equal basis, across
every platform, or whether it should instead focus more on particular or
underserved audiences; and
● Whether the BBC would benefit from having a clearly defined set of values,
establishing through the Charter a set of unique features of the BBC,
including its independence and impartiality.
Public purposes
A very small proportion (5 per cent) of the responses to the consultation indicated a
view on whether the BBC’s public purposes could be improved (consultation
question 11). Of those that did, slightly more of the responses suggesting a view on
this issue indicated that no change was required to the purposes (3 per cent)
compared to those indicating that change was required (2 per cent). Views ranged
from those who argued that ‘the BBC already has strong public purposes’2 to
suggestions for potential changes to the existing public purposes, such as ‘remove or
drastically reduce in scope purposes 3 and 6. Merge purposes 1 and 5.’3
The majority of organisations that responded to the consultation said that the current
approach of high-level public purposes, together with more-specific purpose remits,
provided a helpful framework for the BBC to operate within. The BBC Trust argued
for a clarification and simplification of the current purposes and the development of a
framework to measure the BBC’s performance against these. The BBC Executive
broadly agreed with this view, but suggested an update of the current digital purpose,
as well as recognising in the purposes the BBC’s role in supporting the creative
industries and the importance of partnerships to delivery. Many organisations noted
that the existing purposes, and purpose remits, should be updated to make them
more specific and more relevant for today and for the next decade:
‘The BBC’s six main “purposes” serve the public well and remain as valid
today as when cast, we see no reason to change, expand or contract them as
part of this review. However, the “remit definitions” underpinning each would
be well served by being made more specific, with clearer outcomes, and
brought up-to-date for the coming digital decade to better focus the BBC’s
limited funding.’ BT

Many responses suggested that supporting the wider creative economy and
partnerships should be included in the purposes. A number of responses also
flagged other specific interests that could be considered. These included: supporting
the music industry, emphasising adult education, sports, health, children’s services,
and reflecting and promoting the UK’s nations and regions.
There were very few calls for a significant overhaul of the public purposes and,
overall, there was no consensus on whether the purposes should serve as guidelines
only or be used for performance management. However a number of organisations
argued that the current purposes were too broad, leaving the BBC unconstrained:
‘RIG (Radio Independence Group) agrees with the idea of public purposes
and believes that most of the current six purposes are relevant, but are broad
and require greater definition. For example the purpose requiring it to support
the creative industries could be more clearly defined, measured and
regulated.’ RIG
‘...the BBC’s current public purposes could certainly be improved. In particular
they should provide greater clarity on what the BBC must deliver and prioritise
(its output) and how this is delivered and executed in practice (its impact).’
Radiocentre
Universality
In response to the question about which elements of universality4 are most
important to the BBC (consultation question 25), a little more than a third of
respondents (35 per cent) indicated that all three elements of universality were
important for the BBC.
Of the three different aspects of universality, more than two-fifths (41 per cent)
indicated that providing all types of content and meeting the needs of everyone was
the most important element of universality: ‘It is extremely important to me that the
BBC retains its scope and diversity in programming to serve the widest possible
audience - from CBeebies to Question Time.’6
A little fewer than 12 per cent indicated that the BBC should be accessible on all
platforms (‘It is vital for the BBC to have a presence on all platforms, in order to reach
the widest possible audience.’7) while a slightly smaller proportion (10 per cent)
highlighted covering single unifying events, such as the Proms, royal weddings,
major sporting events and elections, as being an important element of the BBC’s

4

In the Green Paper we sought to define universality in three ways – providing all types of
content that meets the needs of all audiences; bringing the country together for unifying
events; and providing content and services on all available platforms and devices.

universality: ‘A national event isn't a national event if half of the country doesn't get to
see it.’8
Fewer than 3 per cent felt that the BBC should not seek to be universal.
There was no clear consensus on how universality should be defined. The BBC
Trust argued that universality was an even broader concept than defined in the
consultation document and should cover ‘audience reach, range of content and
ensuring that the BBC contributes to the intellectual health of the UK’.
A number of organisations indicated that the BBC must provide a service that is
available to all and therefore one which is free at the point of access. Channel 4
suggested: ‘In an increasingly fragmented world the provision of high quality, easy to
find Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) content is actually more important than ever.’
Many organisations supported the idea that everyone should be able to find
something on the BBC which is for them, but a number of organisations that
supported this view, including the BBC Trust and BBC Executive, also made clear
that ‘something for everyone’ is not the same as doing everything. The BBC
Executive argued that 'universality is not about reaching all audiences per se but
about reaching all audiences with high quality and relevant public services’. The
Commercial Broadcasters Association (COBA) went further, suggesting:
‘The BBC must provide a service that is available to all, free at the point of
use. This does not necessarily mean providing all types of content (though we
believe the BBC has a role in providing popular entertainment). Nor does it
necessarily mean being available (or prominent) on all platforms or devices,
although the BBC should be able to evolve with audience demand where
appropriate. Rather it should provide a service that any licence fee payer can
reasonably access if they choose without further payment.’ Commercial
Broadcasters’ Association.
The Guardian Media Group was one of a number of organisations that felt the most
important parts of universality were those that complement rather than duplicate what
is available in the wider market, with ITV also making the case for ‘a BBC which
thinks and acts differently to the commercial market – taking risks, bringing on new
talent, innovating constantly with new programmes and formats in everything it does’.
Values
A very small proportion (3 per cent) of the responses to the consultation indicated
any view regarding whether Charter Review should formally establish a set of
values for the BBC (consultation question 39). A little fewer than 2 per cent indicated
that it should not (‘Not necessary. I feel the BBC already has a great set of values.’10)

10

while fewer than 1 per cent felt that it should (‘Yes but they need to be clearly
enforced.’11)
A number of organisations agreed that the creation of a set of values explicitly stated
in the Charter could help the BBC’s regulator to assess whether the BBC is
performing as it should, give clearer guidance to BBC staff about the behaviours
expected of them and reinforce the principle of BBC independence.
‘There are a set of values that most people would associate with the BBC and
it would be helpful for Charter Review to establish these in support of the
public purposes. For example impartiality, trust, value for money, transparent
governance, financial accountability and independence.’ The Open
University
Several organisations thought that values were important but that it was more
appropriate for the BBC to set these for itself. Others gave tacit support for the
concept of values but did not make detailed comments on proposals for a specific set
of values or how they should be enshrined.
‘This [setting values] is common practice in the public and private sectors, as
much to help an organisation’s own employees understand its values as
anything else. However, it is not enough to simply establish these values
formally, they must also be enforced.’ The Commercial Broadcasters
Association (COBA)
The BBC Executive said that the values set out in the consultation document
aligned with their ambitions for the BBC: being independent, impartial, high quality,
efficient, value for money, transparent, distinctive, diverse and representative. The
values of independence, impartiality, value for money, and high editorial and creative
standards were the most important among the other respondents that expressed a
view, including the BBC Trust, who added that subjective qualities such as
‘distinctive’ and ‘high quality’ would need to be defined. Examples of other values
mentioned included: diversity, nations and regions, accessibility, transparency and
distinctiveness, creativity, public service partnerships, integrity and training.

Chapter 2: What the BBC does: Scale and scope
The second chapter of the public consultation examined whether the present scale
and scope of the BBC is right for the current and future media environment, and
whether it delivers services that audiences want, are willing to pay for and are in the
public interest, particularly in the context of the development of digital services. The
consultation considered four main aspects of scale and scope:
● Services: whether the BBC is offering the right range of services, taking into
account market impact;
● Audiences: how well the BBC is serving different audiences;
● Content: whether the BBC is providing the right content mix, quality and
distinctiveness; and
● Production: how the BBC’s content should be produced.
Expansion of services
In relation to BBC expansion (consultation question 412), approximately two-thirds
(68 per cent) of responses indicated that this was justified: ‘increased choice justifies
expansion in a multi-platform and multi-channel era’.13 Several organisations agreed
that the expansion of the BBC was justified for reasons including increased choice for
audiences, higher levels of audience expectations and the fast-changing media and
technology landscape.
Fewer than 6 per cent indicated that it was not justified: ‘I would be happy if the BBC
set out to do less but do it better than any other media provider.’14
Fewer than 4 per cent gave a view on whether such expansion was crowding out the
competition and whether this was justified. While a little over 15 per cent of
responses argued that the BBC was not crowding out competitors:
‘I love the iplayer and the BBC content online as well as the high quality
dramas and documentaries especially on Radio 4. I think it’s vital to have that
range of choice and alternatives to commercial media. The BBC adds
positively to the mix of choices available to the consumer and is in no way at
all in danger of crowding out any commercial competition.’15
Just over 3 per cent felt that the BBC was crowding out competitors but that this was
justified: ‘If commercial stations aren’t able to compete with the BBC it’s because
they’re not good enough.’16), while fewer than half a per cent indicated that it was
crowding out competitors and this was not justified.

However, a number of organisations highlighted specific areas of concern with regard
to crowding out of commercial competitors – radio and platform distribution being the
most prominent, as well as some concerns about the BBC’s role in local and
international news provision, and in areas such as food recipes and magazine-style
news content. The News Media Association, for example, argued that:
‘[The BBC is] not quick to heed warnings that its activities might cause
detriment to commercial competitors, nor is it wary of disruption of nascent
markets. For example its expansion into local news has broadened to now
focus on geotagging and towns rather than regions, which it always assured
NMA wouldn’t be the case.’
The Guardian Media Group offered suggestions that might guard against what it
perceives to be negative market impacts such as: ‘A BBC syndication strategy that
would allow the commercial news sector to access the BBC’s news feeds with proper
attribution, with world-leading BBC content embedded within the platforms, products
and services or a whole host of 3rd party providers.’
The BBC Trust argued that the BBC has in fact contracted rather than expanded
during the current Charter period and the BBC Executive said that, as the market
fragments, there is even more need for the BBC. They argue that it has remained
successful despite becoming much smaller relative to the market: ‘We went from
being two of 11 TV channels in 1984, to two out of 61 TV channels in 1994, to nine
out of 536 in 2014.’ A number of organisations echoed this view. For example Arqiva
wrote:
‘There are over 300 TV channels available across free-to-air and pay
platforms in the UK, of which the BBC provides nine. Against the background
of the choice provided by others those nine channels are not excessive.’
Market impact
A little fewer than two-thirds of responses (66 per cent) indicated that the BBC had a
positive wider impact on the market (consultation question 517): ‘[The] BBC creates
a high threshold for quality, which causes other broadcasters to raise their game,
provides opportunities for new talent and presents news that comes without
adverts.’18 ‘The BBC sets high standards and demonstrates real impartiality.’19
Many organisations said that, overall, the BBC has a positive impact on the media
market, agreeing that the BBC raises broadcasting standards and it pioneers and
kick-starts services that commercial providers would find it difficult to lead, such as
the development of the iPlayer. A number of organisations also highlighted that the
BBC greatly contributes to creative industries in the UK, and that it supports and
promotes new British talent. This was particularly so for the music industry.

the market?

'The BBC has a crucial impact across the wider creative industries of the UK.
The creative industries is currently the fastest-growing sector of the economy,
contributing £77 billion of direct GVA (gross value added) in 2012-2013, and
provides high-quality jobs that will not – in the main – be replaced by
automation in the future.’ Creative Industries Federation
'These areas [in which the BBC has a positive impact on the market] include
talent schemes, like BBC Introducing, which is of great merit in terms of
showcasing unsigned talent. More than 130,000 artists have uploaded music
to the BBC Introducing website and 120 have performed at festival stages.’
UK Music
The BBC Executive presented the findings of a report that identified a number of
ways in which the BBC supports private sector growth and further views covered the
BBC’s positive influence on: the creative industries, skills and talent, and job-creation
in rural areas. Others highlighted that the BBC is crucial for the continued success of
the unique broadcasting system in the UK, of independent producers and of the
creative industries in the UK.
Three per cent of respondents said that the BBC had a negative impact on the
market, for example: ‘At regional and local level, BBC services may have some
negative impact by reducing the viability of community services which could offer
better models for local ownership, accountability and content delivery.’20
The BBC Trust argued that the BBC has an overall positive market impact but
recognised that ‘it is very important to guard against the risk of future negative
impacts and stifling of innovation and creativity in the market’.
Negative market impacts referenced in the consultation responses included the
BBC’s impacts on the commercial TV broadcasters, the digital content sector, the
radio market, distribution platform markets and local news.
Commercial TV broadcasters commented on the impact BBC has on their
commercial operations. Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN) previously
made clear its misgivings about Radio 1’s launch of a live music video service, which
‘competes directly with our MTV channels, and the proposed additional two hours of
CBBC which will compete with our Nickelodeon channels.’
ITV shared this concern: ‘However, we are becoming increasingly concerned about
the overall impact of the BBC on the ecology of broadcasting in the UK, particularly
as it concentrates more and more of its spend on the less distinctive, mainstream TV
services, particularly BBC One.’
In relation to the distribution of content, Virgin Media highlighted the impacts of the
BBC’s decision not to offer its content for inclusion on platforms, and said:

20

Response from individual to public consultation.

13

‘The BBC is the only Public Service Broadcaster (PSB) missing from Virgin
Media’s multiscreen linear line-up on our TV Anywhere service. This means
that Virgin Media customers cannot watch BBC linear content on their PC or
mobile or tablet devices. This not only denies Virgin Media customers the
most popular BBC content, but also weakens Virgin Media’s multi-screen
viewing proposition and its competitiveness in the market.’ Virgin Media
Radiocentre argued that the BBC’s share of the overall radio market (54 per cent) is
unsurprising given the advantage it has in broadcast spectrum (owning four out of
five national FM stations, including the only two national FM pop services Radio 1
and Radio 2):
‘Currently too much of the public service content featured on BBC music radio
is broadcast in off-peak hours and has little impact on most of the audience’…
‘This structural and legacy advantage has also been re-enforced by the mass
market proposition provided by its main music radio services at peak times.’
Global also commented on the BBC’s cross-promotion activities, arguing that the
BBC mostly trailed its most popular programmes, rather than those with a high public
service value, and thereby bolstering its dominant position in the radio market.
Global’s own research on this valued the BBC’s cross-promotion activities by
comparing what advertising space would cost and suggested that over the period of
a week:
‘87 per cent of Radio 1 programme trails and promotions on Radio 1 itself
were for its own peak hour programmes. For example, Radio 1 ‘spent’ nearly
£74k advertising its own Breakfast Show, compared with less than £5k for
The Surgery, a programme with significantly more public value potential.’
With regard to local news, the News Media Association felt that the BBC’s activities
create negative market impacts: ‘The BBC’s drive to create its own suite of local
news services across the breadth of the UK’s communities risks damaging the local
press sector which is currently in transition to a sustainable digital world.’
Future technology
Fewer than 3 per cent of responses to the consultation addressed the question of
what the BBC’s role should be in influencing the future technological
landscape, including future radio switchover (consultation question 621). Several
organisations did say, however, that the BBC should continue to play what they
describe as a pioneering and leading role in the development of both broadcasting
and other new technologies, arguing that the whole industry has benefited, with
Fujitsu noting that ‘without these [tech] developments [by the BBC], the UK media
sector would not be in the position it is today and seen as a global leader’, and Cisco
commenting: ‘The BBC is the centre of the media ecosystem of the UK providing a
rallying and unifying force in media technology initiatives.’ Smaller organisations,

Q6: What role should the BBC have in influencing future technological landscape including
in future radio switchover?

such as MoSys, expect the BBC research and development department to continue
to drive and spearhead the development of technologies that will enable tomorrow’s
broadcasting.
A number of organisations that supported this view added that, despite the positive
impact, the BBC’s role can also have some negative consequences, and it should
take greater care to avoid negatively impacting the market. Tech UK felt that the
BBC should not be seeking to overly control the marketplace of receiving devices
designed to receive BBC services or set unrealistic thresholds and controls related to
digital devices. Samsung felt that the BBC should have a role in preparing for future
technology, but not on taking a controlling role in platforms such as Freeview. Some
organisations also argued that the BBC should not be undertaking expensive
research activities which are already being undertaken by the market.
The BBC Trust felt that the BBC should not be pioneering in technology, but said
that they should be making use of developments to support easy access and keep
pace with developments.
The Creative Industries Federation argued that the BBC had addressed earlier
criticism and improved engagement with the digital market, and BECTU (The
Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union) suggested that
‘given the BBC’s close connection with radio audiences, it should be a partner in the
switchover process, not just in decisions about technology, but also in the crucial
decision about timing.’
Overall a little more than 97 per cent of responses did not express a view on this
issue. Fewer than 2 per cent indicated that the BBC should have a very big or
leading role: ‘It should be a leader in new standards to help raise adoption for the
wider industry.’22 Under half a per cent indicated that it should have little or no role
and even fewer suggested that it should have a partnership or moderate role.
Audiences
Over four-fifths of responses (81 per cent) indicated that the BBC is serving its
audiences well (consultation question 723):
‘The BBC provides not only a very high quality standard of broadcasting for
the home audience in the UK, but also an unrivalled World Service
programme which is highly regarded worldwide.’24
‘It provides a broad range of programming making both popular programs and
those more niche programmes that other broadcasters do not.’25

‘[The BBC] Projects vital 'soft power' internationally via the World Service,
with its reputation for impartial, comprehensive, factually accurate news.’26
In contrast, 6 per cent indicated that the BBC was not serving its audiences well or
could improve in this regard. For example: ‘Undoubtedly still issues around
representation of areas such as Scotland, Northern Ireland, regions of England.
Answer to this has to lie in quality, not tokenism’27.
A number of organisations underlined the BBC’s strong performance in serving
national and international audiences.
‘The BBC is freely chosen by UK consumers, in highly competitive markets,
with well-informed customers and zero switching costs, roughly 160 million
times a day – far more than any other brand. At least 97% of individuals
consume its services each week (the figure for households is unknown, but
even higher) for an average of 18 hours a week. If the BBC were not serving
its UK audiences well, why would they consume its products on this
staggering scale, given the amount of choice now available?’ Patrick
Barwise, Emeritus Professor of Management and Marketing, London
Business School
'The BBC’s commitment to women’s football is to be applauded and has
undoubtedly had a positive impact, bringing the sport to new audiences and
helping to ‘normalise’ football as a game for women and girls, not just men
and boys.' The Football Association (FA)
Also the BBC Trust said that, in general, the BBC serves audiences very well but
that ‘the greater diversity in the UK’s population has created challenges with gaps
growing between those who are well served and those who are not so well served.’ It
challenged the BBC Executive to rebalance the BBC’s TV, radio and online services
to serve different audience groups in particular younger, less well off and Black,
Asian, and other minority ethnic groups. The Trust also felt that the BBC World
Service provided ‘an internationally renowned service to international audiences’.
The BBC Executive stressed that audience appreciation and performance figures
have improved during the current Charter, pointing out that the BBC serves almost
everyone in the UK and arguing that it has already taken positive steps in terms of
diversity and representation and put forward proposals to enhance the World
Service.
Many organisations broadly agreed with the view that, while the BBC was in general
serving its national and international audiences well, that there were growing
disparities between its levels of service to different audience groups. Many of these
responses also identified those less well-served groups as young people, less welloff people and those from Black or other minority ethnic communities.

The Campaign for Broadcasting Equality believes there should be specific
diversity obligations for the BBC and suggest that any disparities in levels of service
could be addressed through more representative employment: ‘In relation to
employment, including BAME employment, the departments in BBC business and
production units should be required to reflect the demographics of the population
where they are based’.
Organisations also highlighted challenges facing the BBC in meeting audience
expectation in the devolved nations and across the English regions.
‘In respect of children’s services, the BBC’s reach and audience share
suggest that it is serving the domestic children’s audience well. That is not to
argue that there is no room for continuous improvement, among certain
sections of the audience, and as audience preferences change.’ Jeanette
Steemers, Professor of Media and Communications, University of
Westminster
‘While broadcasters, including the BBC, often respond that older children and
young teens are well served with music radio and their engagement with the
broad range of “family”, 16-24, or general factual content, this is not sufficient.
We believe that all audiences deserve some public service content aimed at
their specific needs. In which case the 10+ group should be recognised as
having life-stage issues and perspectives which need to be addressed. They
deserve specific, relevant, challenging content which in some cases, given
the stage of life they are in, should mean little to the family audience and
should not constitute “joint-viewing” experiences. This is as much their right
as is programming for other minority interest groups.’ Children’s Media
Foundation
With regard to people with disabilities or mental illness, the Communications
Consumer Panel and ACOD (the Advisory Committee on Older and Disabled
People) said: ‘The status of the BBC in mainstream broadcasting means it is also in a
prime position to raise awareness of issues facing parts of its audience and
challenge stigma. But we believe the BBC could do still more.’ They added that the
BBC continues to provide excellent levels of accessibility:
‘The BBC’s provision of access services allows disabled people to enjoy
mainstream programming and provides programming via a range of
platforms, so that people can watch, listen and participate in high quality
entertainment of their choice, regardless of their household income. The
number of people in the UK aged 65 and over is growing. PSB remains very
important to older consumers, who often use PSB channels as background
content or as company. Older people watch more TV than any other group.’
A large number of organisations based in the nations and regions asked for improved
representation and more tailored services as well as increased funding. The Welsh
Government stated ‘[t]he BBC must take a more representative approach to

17

commissioning and production from and for the nations and regions.’ Northern Film
and Media stated: ‘Productions which include North East characters are currently
commissioned and often produced outside the region, and tend to lead to results
which many find unconvincing and unsatisfying.’ Organisations based in the nations
and regions also mentioned strengthening the arrangements for accountability to,
and scrutiny by, the nations and regions. For example, the Northern Ireland
Executive stated: ‘Funding decisions that … relate to the Devolved Administrations
should be made locally.’
A specific issue highlighted by a number of organisations was the concern over
provision for minority language broadcasting. Frequently, organisations from the
devolved nations called for more resources, responsibility and partnerships (with
local partners) to deliver nation-specific content. There were also specific concerns,
particularly from organisations in Scotland and Northern Ireland, that there is a lack
of consistency in minority language provision by the BBC. MG Alba said ‘the time is
right for the BBC to articulate a consistent philosophy on supporting investment in
autochthonous language programming’.
The responses highlighted that the service provided by the BBC to international
audiences is high quality and well regarded, but some organisations were concerned
about international excellence being provided at the expense of UK audiences and
licence fee payers. Others, such as the Guardian Media Group, expressed concern
about the relationship between the BBC’s national and international activities,
particularly international activities undertaken by the BBC’s commercial subsidiaries.
A number of specific ideas were offered to ensure that the BBC is serving its national
and international audiences better in the future, such as the improvement of
commissioning models and calls for increased resources.
Genre mix
Relatively few (20 per cent) consultation responses gave views on whether the BBC
has the right genre mix across its services (consultation question 828).
More than 15 per cent of respondents indicated that the genre mix was right. This
includes those who said it was mostly or generally right, such as ‘[y]es, but more scifi’29 and ‘[t]he only area in which I find current services inadequate is comedy’.30
Nearly 4 per cent indicated that the BBC did not have the right mix – ‘[n]o, too many
reality shows, not enough arts, documentaries (which the BBC excels in) good
comedy, satire, drama, sport, news’.31
Many organisations believed that the BBC should continue to commission a broad
selection of programmes across the full genre range, thereby serving licence fee
payers as fully as possible. Many also highlighted that the BBC should not be limited
to addressing ‘market failure’ in content provision, or as Arqiva put it: the ‘new

Charter should require the BBC to make the good popular and the popular good’.
The BBC Trust agreed that a range of genres is important and is one of the key
ways of ensuring the BBC fulfils its public purposes.
In contrast, several organisations argued that the BBC could even go further and
improve its programming mix. ITV was critical of the genre mix and the BBC’s
approach to scheduling on BBC One, stating that ‘the BBC has progressively
marginalized any content at any time of day that will not maximize share in the
particular schedule slot’.
On radio, both Global and Radiocentre argued that the BBC fails to be sufficiently
distinctive in its genre mix. Radiocentre suggested that ‘while it is indisputable that
BBC radio plays a wide range of music genres and tracks throughout the week, it
does not do this to such an extent during daytime when the vast majority of listeners
tune-in’. It provided data that it believes illustrates an insufficient range.
Many of the other responses provided comments on more-specific issues, including:
children’s and young people’s content, regional programming and the BBC’s
coverage of technology and science, sport and music.
Quality and distinctiveness
Almost three-quarters of responses (74 per cent) indicated that the BBC’s content is
sufficiently high quality and distinctive from that of other broadcasters
(consultation question 932): ‘It is always high quality and can be relied upon to set the
bar for standards of impartiality, innovation and creativity.’33 ‘The BBC is of the
highest quality. It becomes less distinct from other broadcasters because where the
BBC leads, others follow/copy.’34
Eight per cent suggested that it was not sufficiently high quality or distinctive.
‘Distinctiveness could be improved by channelling more funding into
innovative content making and programmes, particularly for factual
programming and the arts, to promote and support best of British thinking and
creativity in a way that couldn't be achieved by a commercial operator
focussed on profit.’35
The BBC Trust strongly recommended that the future Charter sets out a
distinctiveness requirement more clearly and that the requirement for each BBC
service to be distinctive should be included in its service licence. In its response, the
BBC Executive also noted that distinctiveness was important and set out proposals
for how BBC content could become more distinctive in the future. They highlighted
some of the ways that distinctiveness can be measured and said they would

‘welcome a dialogue with the government on how to best define and assess
distinctiveness’.
Many other organisations believed that the BBC’s content is sufficiently high quality
and distinctive from that of other broadcasters, particularly when looking at some of
the BBC’s more specialist and niche services such as BBC Three and Radio 3.
Voice of the Listener and Viewer (VLV) argued that the BBC should not be
‘beholden primarily to ratings and that it should always assess the success of its
output using a range of measures’.
‘The BBC’s approach to encouraging more people to play more sport is
distinctive from other mainstream broadcasters, with the BBC focusing
specifically on the links between watching and playing sport, and providing
audiences with tailored resources and information to get more people playing
sport.’ Sport England
‘We welcome BBC Arts’ focus on raising the profile of artists working across
the UK, working in partnership with key UK cultural organisations and working
to ensure that high quality, thoughtful and engaging arts content is developed
across the BBC’s platforms from BBC 4 to Radio 1 that works to support arts
and culture across the network and nations and regions.’ Creative Scotland
Other specific reforms were suggested that could increase quality and
distinctiveness. Some organisations, particularly commercial competitors, noted that
the BBC should do more to ensure that its largest services can demonstrate
distinctiveness of content across the schedule, not just on individual landmark
productions. Many suggested reforms such as more-specific remits and service
licences for TV and radio stations.
ITV highlighted concerns over the BBC’s distinctiveness record on its most popular
television services (BBC One and Two). Sky also sees a need for the BBC to be
more distinctive and face more stringent tests on this, and the Guardian Media
Group puts forward the argument that:
‘BBC’s online’s increasing focus on ‘soft news’ or magazine content … is
duplicating content already produced by the commercial sector, which is
critical to enabling commercial brands such as the Guardian to attract
advertising and sponsorship to their digital propositions’.
VIMN added ‘we do not believe the BBC should move into areas already well
covered by existing providers unless it can offer something new and distinctive.’
VIMN, Channel 5
Content production
More than 98 per cent of the consultation responses did not express a view on
whether the system of content production should be improved through reform

20

of quotas or more radical options (consultation question 1036). Fewer than 1 per
cent indicated that the system should not be changed and even fewer responses
indicated that it should be changed.
A number of organisations were opposed to reforming the current system and to any
changes affecting the production sector, arguing that the current mix has worked well
and that the quota system should be maintained. BECTU disagreed with proposals
for the removal of a guaranteed level of in-house production and the Producers
Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact) strongly welcomed Ofcom’s findings in
its recent review of public service broadcasting37 that there is not a strong enough
case at this stage for reform of either the 25 per cent independent production quota.
'The 25% independent production quota for PSBs … ensures that there is a
diversity of supply in the UK’s public service broadcasters. Pact believes that
… it continues to be appropriate for the public service broadcasters, who
receive privileged PSB benefits such as EPG prominence in return for their
PSB obligations, should be required to commission content from a larger pool
of suppliers than their non-PSB commercial rivals (who are subject to the
10% independent production quota as per the European Directive).' - Pact
Channel 4 also did ‘not support radical reforms such as the BBC reducing its inhouse production base entirely’.
The BBC Trust agreed with the view that the existing quotas had been generally
positive and facilitated creative competition but argued that there was ‘a strong case
for change by at least reducing or potentially removing the in-house [TV] guarantee’
to reflect changes in the market and in the BBC.
The BBC Executive argued that there was value in retaining a number sources, or
‘mixed ecology’ of BBC content supply but did propose a number of reforms to its
current content supply framework. This included increasing competition for content
spend across television, radio and online, whilst also retaining significant in-house
capability across these services, as well as creating a new commercial production
subsidiary called “BBC Studios”.
Many organisations agreed with the rationale for reviewing this regulatory framework
and with a number of the proposed options for reform, but questioned the merit of
any proposals that might lead to a significant loss of in-house expertise within the
BBC. Others considered the current system increasingly unworkable given the
number of suppliers that no longer qualify as statutory independent producers and
which, under the current “Window of Creative Competition” rules, can only compete
for 25 per cent of BBC commissions.

COBA said its members would welcome the BBC opening up a greater degree of
commissioning to competition from external suppliers. Channel 4 also recognised
‘that removing in-house guarantees and opening up BBC Productions will stimulate
additional competition in the sector and ensure that viewers get the best ideas’.
Many organisations shared concerns about the potential long-term impacts of the
BBC Studios proposal with a number going as far as saying it should not be taken
forward at all. VLV asked for caution when considering the possibility of BBC Studios
buying other independent production companies as part of its approach. Channel 4
indicated that it found the BBC Studios proposal interesting but wanted to ensure that
BBC Productions were not able to unfairly offer lower prices than independent
producers, and that any new arrangements must undergo careful regulatory scrutiny
to ensure fair and transparent competition with other producers. ITV argued for a
broader review of the BBC’s fair trading regime originating from the conclusions of
the recently published BBC Trust commissioned report on the BBC’s fair trading
arrangements38.

Chapter 3: BBC funding
The BBC currently receives over £3.7 billion of public investment each year from the
TV licence fee. This public money is supplemented by commercial revenues
generated by the BBC, giving the BBC Group an overall income of £4.8 billion a year.
This third chapter of the consultation document looks at four funding issues:
● The funding model (options for future funding models for the BBC including a
modernised licence fee, an alternative household levy and elements of
subscription, and the issue of decriminalisation of TV licence evasion);
● Protected uses of licence fee funds (what the licence fee can and must be
used for, including the option of contestable funding);
● Value for money and efficiency (how the BBC spends its money and the
mechanisms for making sure it makes savings where possible);
● The BBC’s commercial activities (how the BBC generates its own income).
Licence fee modernisation
In terms of how we should pay for the BBC and whether the licence fee should
be modernised (consultation question 1139), three-fifths of responses felt that no
changes to the current system were required.
‘I believe the BBC should continue to be funded the way it is, ensuring that an
advertising free, non-biased service is available to all at a fair cost.’40
A further 15 per cent indicated that there should be some sort of licence fee reform,
such as closing the ‘iPlayer loophole’.41 ‘The iPlayer loophole does not make sense,
particularly as more people use the internet and mobile phones.’42
A far smaller proportion of responses indicated preferences for other options. A little
more than 4 per cent suggested that there should be a Universal Household Levy: ‘a
household levy would ensure that everyone continues to pay for what is a national
service.’43 Just over 3 per cent favoured full subscription funding: ‘The BBC should
be required to compete for subscription or advertising custom, as with its commercial
competitors.’44 A little more than 2 per cent favoured a mixture of subscription and
public funding: ‘consider a subscription service for some, but not all, aspects, ie the
more specialised stations/services.’45 While not an option put forward in the
consultation document, 1 per cent suggested that the BBC should be funded through
advertising.

The majority of organisations agreed that an update of the licence fee was necessary
for a number of reasons, including the ‘iPlayer loophole’ as well as changes in
technology and in the viewing behaviours of audiences. Most organisations were
supportive of a modernised licence fee in the short-term and some provided ideas on
how it could be reformed. The need to close the ‘iPlayer loophole’ was widely
recognised; however, Channel 4 and ITV strongly disagreed that all PSB catch-up
services should be included in any change. VIMN stated that it ‘cannot see why use
of all Public Service Broadcasters’ catch-up services should require payment of the
licence fee’.
A number of organisations indicated that a move to any new model should not mean
loss of funding for the BBC and that achieving universality is an important
consideration for any reform to the BBC’s funding model. In addition, security of
funding, as well as independence, were both seen as very important and of value to
UK broadcasting sector.
Many organisations were interested in the idea of a universal levy, including the BBC
Executive which stated: ‘Medium-term reform of the licence fee by universally
levying it on all households, as happens in Germany, merits consideration.’ Most
underlined that more research should be done in order to understand the
consequences of such a levy. Professor Freedman, Goldsmiths, University of
London, argued that: ‘A flat-rate and platform-neutral household payment is a logical
way of moving away from what is easily characterised as an outdated television
licence fee’, but that ‘there is nevertheless a need to answer critics who argue that
both the licence fee and a flat household levy are regressive as they fail to take
account of income differences’. Many others also underlined that they have general
concerns about the regressive nature of the licence fee and levy, which they felt
should be addressed during the Charter Review.
There was little support from organisations for the subscription model. Many strongly
argued against the idea of subscription, suggesting it was impractical, could damage
the market and was not in line with the philosophy of the BBC. BT stated that: ‘the
BBC would find itself allocating a non-trivial portion of its budget towards acquisition,
retention and renewal of ‘subscription customers’ which would mean less money
spent on content creation.’
A number of organisations also noted that the funding of the BBC should be
independent from political decisions:
‘The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) believes there must be a mechanism
which protects decisions on the BBC’s funding from political interference.’
NUJ

24

Protected funding
Considering whether funding for certain services or programmes should be
protected (consultation question 12),46 the BBC Trust and BBC Executive did not
support the idea of protected funding and the Trust argued that ‘ring-fencing parts of
the licence fee for certain activities undermines the BBC’s independence, and
contestable funding [made available to other providers] would put at risk the level of
BBC investment and reduce accountability to the licence fee payer.’
Many organisations opposed the idea of protecting funding through ring-fencing
money for certain types of content or ‘top-slicing’ funds from the licence fee, and
stressed that it should be up to the BBC to decide the relative funding of its services.
However, a number of responses from organisations did suggest areas where
funding should be protected or ring-fenced. The most frequent calls were for ringfencing children’s TV, minority languages generally and S4C specifically. The Ofcom
Advisory Committee for Wales said there was ‘a strong justification for protecting
the funding of S4C from further reductions’. Other areas mentioned included: inhouse programming, programming for devolved nations, training for the media
industry, UK film, sport (particularly in relation to health/participation and major
events), radio and music (particularly music TV programming), religious
programming, arts programming, education and learning, and access services for
disabled viewers. Many organisations with regional and national interests call for an
increase in funding in the nations and regions.
Most of the organisations responding to the consultation that answered this question
did not support contestable funding. Enders Analysis suggested that contestable
funding has major drawbacks in terms of budget assessment and coordination,
financial and regulatory accountability, regulation of competitive tenders and
separation of public funding into silos.
However, some organisations told us that they might approve of contestable funding
in certain situations, for example where it enabled partnership working, or created
services which were particularly distinct from BBC services. Creative England said:
‘The BBC should develop regionally ring-fenced pots of funding which individuals and
companies in the regions could bid for on a competitive basis’ to help develop
‘clusters of specialist skills and businesses [in the regions]’.
Fujitsu said: ‘Funding should be made available to other providers to deliver public
service content, as long as it is distinct from what is already offered by the BBC,
Channel 4 and “S4C”.’
A very small proportion (8 per cent) of the consultation responses from individuals
indicated a view regarding whether funding for certain services or programmes
should be protected.

46

Q12: Should the level of funding for certain services or programmes be protected? Should
some funding be made available to other providers to deliver public service content?

25

A little fewer than 5 per cent of responses from individuals indicated that the funding
for some services should be protected, with a range of services suggested, for
example: ‘The BBC World Service should be protected, as it is invaluable in
spreading British values overseas’.47 One per cent indicated that no services should
have their funding protected.
An even smaller proportion expressed a view on whether funding should be made
available to other providers to deliver public service content. More than 1 per cent of
responses felt funding should not be made available to other providers: ‘The licence
fee should only pay for BBC services.’48 Fewer than 1 per cent felt that funding
should be made available to other providers usually with some sort of conditions
attached: ‘Funding should not be given to other providers unless they are delivering
unbiased, public service content.’49
Value for money
Findings of research published by the BBC Trust in February 2015 on what should
be the focus of the BBC during the next Charter period found that, from a total of
twenty-six suggested areas of focus, 87 per cent of respondents thought that ‘making
sure it provides value for money’ should be an important area of focus for the BBC.50
Three-quarters of responses (76 per cent) to the government consultation suggested
that the BBC has been doing enough to deliver value for money (consultation
question 1351), for example: ‘The range and quality of the content it provides is
remarkable for the price of the licence fee.’52 ‘Given the innovations such as iplayer,
the superb range of TV and radio, and the website I believe the BBC delivers
excellent value for money.’53
A little above one in ten responses (11 per cent) indicated that the BBC had not done
enough to deliver value for money: ‘[What] the BBC needs to do is to prune its layers
of management structure so more funds are available for producing and
commissioning what it does so well.’54
Not all organisations answered this question in great detail, with many citing that it
was not a matter for them to comment on the BBC’s value-for-money record.
The BBC Trust reported that ‘independent reviews of the National Audit Office and
PwC have recognised the progress the BBC has made in becoming more efficient

over this Charter period’ and the BBC Executive argued that it has transformed its
efficiency record but recognised that it must ‘continue to improve [its] efficiency over
the next Charter period’.
Many of the responses from organisations in the nations and regions stated that the
BBC provides good value for money but also underlined that the BBC could go even
further to improve this. A number of organisations referenced senior management
salaries as a value-for-money concern as well as the BBC’s plans to launch other
services while closing existing services or significantly scaling them back.
‘This year the number of senior managers being paid over £160,000 has
increased by 66 to 74, the salary bills of talent have increased, and the
corporation has outlined a number of new initiatives in the past year since
announcing the closure of BBC Three.’ Save the BBC
The Open University suggested that the BBC could deliver more ‘by making better
use of its established partnerships and in the way that it appeals to and develops
new, key partners’, and argued in favour of allowing it to deliver a cohesive and
consistent service and not merely to provide or to fund content.
Commercial operations
Many organisations highlighted the role BBC Worldwide has in ‘bringing the UK to
the World’ and in providing a dividend stream to the BBC. However, in general, there
was a sense from those organisations who felt that they were impacted by BBC
Worldwide’s operations that the current fair trading arrangements between the BBC
and BBC Worldwide and BBC Global News needed further clarity and improvement.
A number of organisations suggested areas in which reforms were needed, primarily
highlighting that transparency and competition should be increased. For example,
COBA stressed: ‘It is important there is clear separation between [the BBC’s] public
service and commercial activities. To this end BBC Worldwide should be more
transparent.’ The Guardian Media Group raised concerns that ‘there should be
greater transparency in its interactions with news services’.
NBCUniversal suggested that BBC Worldwide should ‘be encouraged to pursue
growth through greater partnerships and joint ventures, across all their activities,
rather than through a privatisation route’. NBCUniversal also ‘sympathise with the
view that BBC Worldwide and Studios be able to pursue activities beyond their
respective “walled gardens”, but suggest that this could be more appropriately
achieved through increased collaboration and business dealings with other players in
the creative industries’.
ITV called for ‘a genuinely open and independent review of the BBC’s actual
implementation of the fair trading rules, particularly around transfer pricing’.
Of those organisations that suggested more significant reform, Fujitsu said that BBC
Worldwide needed to have greater commercial flexibility, that could be achieved

27

through full or partial privatisation, and that such a move would benefit licence fee
payers.
The BBC Trust did not believe that ‘the privatisation or sale of BBC Worldwide would
be in the interests of the licence fee payer’ but does note that ‘further consideration of
ways to build its value for licence fee payers is sensible’.
The BBC Executive argued that BBC Worldwide is a well-run commercial venture
and stated: ‘BBC Worldwide is materially important to the BBC’s overall financial
model and its ability to fund content.’
Overall, just over 6 per cent of the consultation responses provided any view in
relation to whether the BBC’s commercial operations, including BBC

Chapter 4: BBC governance and regulation
Good governance and regulation are vital to a successful BBC, and the last chapter
of the consultation explored the impact of the introduction of the BBC Trust as a
result of the last Charter. The consultation looked at:
● Options for reform of the BBC’s Governance and Regulatory arrangements;
● Public engagement (how the BBC is transparent with, listens to, and engages
effectively with the public);
● Government and Parliament (the independence of the BBC, the appropriate
relationship between the BBC and the UK’s democratic structures);
● Royal Charter (whether a ten-year Charter continues to strike the right
balance)).
Models of governance and regulation
A relatively small proportion (15 per cent) of the consultation responses from
individuals indicated a view about how current models of governance and
regulation for the BBC should be reformed (consultation question 1556). The
views expressed indicate that reform resulting in the regulation of the BBC going to a
single external regulator is the most popular of the other options (a little over 5 per
cent of responses). For example: ‘The Trust should be replaced by a more efficient
and independent regulator, that can deal with complaints more effectively and hold
the BBC to account more readily.’57
Just under 4 per cent suggested Ofcom for this role, and 3 per cent mentioned other
reform. Just over 1 per cent indicated that the BBC Trust should be reformed but
retained, and just under 2 per cent indicated that governance and regulation do not
need changing.
The majority of organisations were supportive of reforming the BBC’s current model
of governance and regulation, but there were a variety of views as to how this would
be best achieved. The most common view was that there should be a unitary board
with some form of independent regulation, although there were different views as to
which regulatory model would be preferable.
The BBC Trust believed that ‘reform of the current structure is necessary to give
greater clarity of responsibilities and accountabilities and to improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of oversight and scrutiny’. The Trust proposed the creation of a
unitary board with a majority of independently appointed non-executive directors and
a non-executive Chairman. The Trust also argued that an external regulator is likely
to be the best model for regulating the BBC.
The BBC Executive also said that the future model for the governance and
regulation of the BBC should include a single, unitary BBC Board independent of
government, with regulation by a single body outside of the Corporation.

Response from individual to public consultation.

Many other organisations saw the need for reform to address perceived confusion
about responsibilities of governance and regulation. Some recognised the positive
steps forward in the last Charter period. VIMN was of the opinion that the BBC Trust
was an improvement which allowed greater transparency and scrutiny: ‘We would be
opposed to any new arrangement that diminished visibility of the BBC’s actions –
indeed we would prefer a structure in which there was greater transparency.’
Of the options available for external regulation, Ofcom was the body that
organisations generally preferred. Rondo Media argued that Ofcom should be the
regulator as they suggested that they ‘…are confident that Ofcom would be a fair
regulator of the BBC, not least due to its understanding of the BBC’s importance in
the wider UK Public Service Broadcasting ecology as demonstrated in the
conclusions of its third report on PSB’.
Likewise, Sky support this model because:
‘In the first instance such a move would bring all media regulation within a
single body with the necessary expertise and understanding of the sector as a
whole. Ofcom has wide information gathering powers, which would give it
access to the information needed for it to discharge its regulatory functions.
Both transitional and ongoing costs would likely be lower under this option
than alternatives, given Ofcom’s existing resources. As the consultation
notes, this model clearly divides governance and regulation, removing a
conflict of interest. Meanwhile, content regulation need in no way compromise
the BBC’s impartiality or independence, just as it does not for rival
broadcasters.’
Other groups gave support to the idea of a standalone regulator separate to Ofcom.
For example the VLV recommended: ‘the BBC should have an external public
interest body. This public interest body would engage with licence fee payers,
conduct public value tests of proposed new services, conduct research to measure
whether the BBC has fulfilled its public purposes, represent the interests of licence
fee payers and hold the BBC Board to account.’
However, some other organisations criticised this approach. BECTU, for example
argued:
‘[We] have reservations about Ofcom being appointed as the final regulator.
Its roots are in the commercial broadcasting sector, although there has long
been an overlap with public sector broadcasting, and we would be concerned
about its ability to properly reflect the views of Licence payers, and the
national and regional interests of UK citizens who use BBC services.’
A number of organisations noted the need to ensure any new governance and
regulatory arrangements adequately represented the different regions and Nations of
the UK. There were varied views as to how far such representation should go.

30

Public value tests and service licences
Just fewer than 2 per cent of responses offered any views on how public value
tests and service licences should be reformed, and who should have
responsibility for making these decisions (consultation question 1658), likely
reflecting the technical nature of these issues. A little over 1 per cent indicated that
no reform was needed while under 1 per cent felt that it was.
Most organisations were supportive of public value tests and service licences and
said that they were useful tools, but suggested reform was needed. The BBC Trust
itself took this position, suggesting that public value tests and service licences
worked well and should be developed further (e.g. to be more flexible in some areas
or more focused in others) but that they should be maintained, even if changes are
made to the governance structure.
While a small number of organisations believed that no reform was needed, many
proposed changes to the service licence regime. Channel 4 argued that there should
be a formal integration of market impact assessments in the service review process,
and suggested that service licences and market impact assessments should apply to
both the BBC’s linear (e.g. traditional TV or radio broadcasting) and non-linear (e.g.
online) services. Others emphasised that the reviews of service licences need to take
account of the market in which the services operate, and suggested that stricter
service licences would make the BBC more distinctive as well as innovative. Some
highlighted that service licences should contain more detailed and measurable
objectives for the BBC’s services with clear consequences for non-delivery. Global
Radio, for example, made a clear recommendation that ‘The Service Licences that
determine the remit for each station need to be independently set by the regulator
(Ofcom), much more tightly defined, monitored and enforced’.
A number of organisations provided detailed input with regard to ideas for the reform
of the public value tests. Some thought that public value tests represented a marked
improvement in the way BBC proposals are assessed, but noted that the process can
be lengthy and cumbersome. Further, the Guardian Media Group expressed
concerns about the power of the BBC Trust to decide when a Public Value Test is
triggered, irrespective of Ofcom’s findings. It suggested that ‘this type of circular
governance is unfair, ineffective, and undermined trust in the system of governance
in which the BBC operates’.
Sky suggested that the current division of responsibilities between the BBC Trust
and Ofcom results in a lack of clarity and certainty for market operators. COBA noted
that ‘currently the Trust must balance public value with market impact, but where the
overall outcome is unclear or marginal, the Trust approves proposals despite the
overall risk of a negative impact on the market’.

Q16: How should Public Value Tests and Service Licences be reformed and who should
have the responsibility for making these decisions?

31

Engagement
A little more than 94 per cent of responses did not indicate any views over how the
BBC could improve engagement with licence fee payers and the industry,
including through research, transparency and complaints handling
(consultation question 1759). Over 4 per cent of responses suggested more
engagement was required. For example: Complaint processes should be made much
simpler and much more accessible. At present they are not accessible and are made
complicated which serves to deter feedback and complaints from the public.’60 While
just over 1 per cent felt no change was needed: ‘The BBC website is an excellent
means of engagement and is very accessible.’61
The BBC Trust suggested that the Charter should include high-level requirements
about engagement with audiences, but that it should not be too prescriptive about
how this is done. The BBC Executive stressed that the BBC will do more to engage
with licence fee payers and be accountable to them in the next Charter. On
complaints, the Executive stated that it was open to options on how to simplify and
streamline editorial complaints handling without reducing accountability to audiences,
and underlined the strong track record of the BBC in transparency.
A number of organisations noted that the engagement of the BBC with organisations
and audiences currently works well. However, many responses called for
improvements with regard to industry partnerships, audience engagement,
complaints handling and transparency. For example, Fujitsu argues that the BBC
has embraced social media platforms, but is concerned that this is alienating the
upper age groups and disadvantaged sections of the UK population.
A number of organisations referenced the importance of the need for the BBC to
work better in partnership. Virgin Media said: ‘Overall, the BBC needs to adopt a
different mind-set. It should seek to become a partner with the wider industry.’ Arts
Council England stated: ‘The BBC has acknowledged challenges in its ability to
work in partnership. It should review its progress continually in trying to become a
more open and collaborative organisation.’
The BBC’s transparency was a prominent issue for a number of organisations. Some
were of the opinion that there was a good degree of transparency in many areas, but
less so around commissioning information and production costs. Sky underlined that
an ‘an increase in transparency would help the BBC to be more accountable to
licence fee payers, and ensure that the decisions it makes deliver greater value for
money and distinctiveness.’ The British Film Institute highlighted that ‘the BBC
should work on the basis that all its data is made available on an ‘open data’ basis
except where it can justify non-disclosure on grounds of commercial sensitivity’, and
that all audience research should be made public. Pact noted a concern that
proposals for governance and regulation must include a method through which

organisations and suppliers to the BBC can complain about an issue and receive a
fair, quick response, and that decisions of the regulator should be binding on the
BBC.
Relationship between Parliament, government, Ofcom, the National Audit Office and
the BBC
With regard to how the relationship between Parliament, government, Ofcom,
the National Audit Office and the BBC should work, and what accountability
structures and expectations, including financial transparency and spending
controls should apply (consultation question 1862), just three-quarters (73 per cent)
of responses highlighted that the BBC should remain independent from one or more
of government, Parliament and Ofcom. In addition, nearly 21 per cent of responses
separately highlighted that the BBC should remain independent.
‘At the present we have an independent service provided by the BBC which
we trust.’63
‘I want a BBC which is independent of party politics but is accountable to a
body representative of the people of the UK.’64
‘It is essential to the objective journalism provided by the BBC remain free
from government intervention.’65
Slightly fewer than one in ten indicated that the relationship between the various
bodies or accountability structures should be changed, while only 4 per cent
indicated that no change was necessary.
The BBC Trust underlined its view that independence and accountability are
fundamental principles of the BBC. It noted that the UK Parliament, as well as the
Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, should have the
right to ask questions of the BBC but that setting out these relationships in the
Charter would increase the understanding and protection of the BBC’s
independence.
Most organisations asserted that it was important for the BBC to be independent from
government. VIMN said that ‘the independence of the BBC is central to its role and
purpose. As such, it should not be treated as if it was a government department.’
Some put forward the idea that that the licence fee should be set by an independent
body, while others argued that the BBC needs independence from the political cycle.
ITV argued that the BBC’s board should be more accountable to Parliament and
suggested that the National Audit Office (NAO) should have more powers and

resources to carry out value-for-money assessments. COBA agreed that the NAO
should have greater oversight of the BBC’s costs.
Some organisations argued for the devolved administrations’ institutions to be
involved in this relationship, suggesting that the BBC should be accountable to each
in the respective nations.
Royal Charter
Fewer than 2 per cent of responses commented on whether the BBC's existing
framework of a 10-year Royal Charter and Framework Agreement between the
BBC and the Secretary of State should remain in place (consultation question
1966). Just over 1 per cent of responses indicated it should continue: ‘The current
approach gives the BBC the certainty of funding it requires in order to best fulfil its
public service role.’67 Under half a per cent felt the Charter period should be shorter
or have a break point. Even fewer indicated that the Charter period should be longer.
The BBC Trust’s response stated that the current Royal Charter model should
continue as it guarantees independence of the BBC. However, the Trust highlighted
the value of an 11-year Charter, so that the next renewal period allows sufficient time
for government and public consultation following the 2025 general election. Further,
the Trust felt that it was essential that the next Charter and Framework Agreement
clearly set out the timing and process for the next Charter renewal.
The BBC Executive argued that a long-term Charter underpins the BBC’s
independence and that the debate about the BBC’s scale and funding should be
taken out of the political cycle in the future, and this view was also supported by a
number of other organisations.
A small number of organisations supported the idea of a shorter Charter due to the
pace of development in the media sector. Many more argued that the Charter length
should, as a minimum, be 10 years, with many preferring 11 or 12 years. There were
concerns that a short Charter period would create a risk of ‘almost perpetual Charter
Review’ (VIMN). A great number of organisations saw the benefits of decoupling the
Charter cycle from the electoral cycle, as proposed by the BBC Trust, agreeing that it
would remove the risk of electoral uncertainty impacting on the Charter Review
process.
Few respondents commented on the idea of a mid-term review, however some
industry bodies did see the merit in undertaking such a review given the pace of
change in the media industry. ITV said:
‘...we do recognize the case for a mid-term review of the Charter and
Agreement if a 10 year agreement is reached. This is important given the
pace of change in the industry and the fact that the outcome of the current
66

continue?

Response from individual to public consultation.

34

process is likely to be a changed approach to the regulation and governance
of the BBC. There is clearly some logic, therefore, in a review of the new
approach after the first few years of operation’.

Annex B: Analysis of responses
The consultation was published on the GOV.UK website. A simple way for the public
to respond to this consultation was created via an online survey, which allowed
respondents to answer each question in turn. Contact details were also provided for
respondents who wished to send email or written responses.
Safeguards were put in place to reduce multiple responses to the online survey by
allowing only one response to be submitted per computer. While restricting multiple
responses from an individual computer was a reasonable precaution to limit the
number of duplicate responses received to the online survey, it was not reasonably
possible to stop individual people responding multiple times by email. Where
possible, duplicate email responses were identified and removed. Online survey and
email responses were stored electronically.
Analysing responses
Responses were analysed by a dedicated team of coders. All team members
completed training on: the Charter Review, the public consultation, how to analyse
responses and unconscious bias.
Responses were analysed against a 60-code framework, specifically designed to
allow analysis of a large volume of material. This framework was developed by
analysing a sample of responses to identify substantive points raised, pertinent to
each question in the consultation, which were then developed into codes.
Each consultation response was then read and allocated the respective codes that it
reflected. A single code could only be used once for each response, preventing
undue weight being given to specific responses. A sample of responses was checked
to ensure that the coding was accurate.
