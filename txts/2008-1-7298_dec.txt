Draft Cultural Property
(Armed Conflicts) Bill
Ministerial Foreword

1

Foreword by the Minister of State for Culture, Media and Sport
This Bill will help to ensure the security of the nation’s most important cultural property in the
event of armed conflict and will send a signal to the international community that the UK takes
seriously its obligations under international humanitarian law to respect and safeguard the cultural
property of other nations.
This Bill is required to enable the UK to ratify the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of
Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (the Hague Convention) and accede to its two
Protocols (1954 and 1999). The Convention, adopted following the massive destruction which
took place during the Second World War, provides a system to protect cultural property from the
effects of international and domestic armed conflict. Parties to the Convention are required to
respect cultural property situated within the territory of other Parties by not attacking it, and to
respect cultural property within their own territory by not using it for purposes which are likely
to expose it to destruction or damage during armed conflict.
During the pre-legislative scrutiny process the Government would welcome any comments on this
draft Bill from interested parties. Comments should be sent by e-mail to
stephen.hodgson@culture.gsi.gov.uk.

recent armed conflicts and that, by reason of the developments in the

whatsoever means damage to the cultural heritage of all mankind, since
each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world;

5

10

Considering that the preservation of the cultural heritage is of great
importance for all peoples of the world and that it is important that this
heritage should receive international protection;
Guided by the principles concerning the protection of cultural property
during armed conflict, as established in the Conventions of The Hague of
1899 and of 1907 and in the Washington Pact of 15 April, 1935;

referred to in Article 3.

concerned. Nevertheless, whenever possible, the latter Party shall first
request the cessation of such violation within a reasonable time.
2. Apart from the case provided for in paragraph 1 of the present Article,
immunity shall be withdrawn from cultural property under special
protection only in exceptional cases of unavoidable military necessity, and

Party shall be notified, a reasonable time in advance, of the decision to

Article 14. Objections
1. Any High Contracting Party may, by letter addressed to the DirectorGeneral of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, lodge an objection to the registration of cultural property. This
letter must be received by him within four months of the day on which he
sent a copy of the application for registration.
2. Such objection shall state the reasons giving rise to it, the only valid
grounds being that:
(a) the property is not cultural property;
(b) the property does not comply with the conditions mentioned in
Article 8 of the Convention.
3. The Director-General shall send a copy of the letter of objection to the High
Contracting Parties without delay. He shall, if necessary, seek the advice of
the International Committee on Monuments, Artistic and Historical Sites
and Archaeological Excavations and also, if he thinks fit, of any other
competent organization or person.
4. The Director-General, or the High Contracting Party requesting
registration, may make whatever representations they deem necessary to
the High Contracting Parties which lodged the objection, with a view to
causing the objection to be withdrawn.
5. If a High Contracting Party which has made an application for registration
in time of peace becomes involved in an armed conflict before the entry has
been made, the cultural property concerned shall at once be provisionally
entered in the Register, by the Director-General, pending the confirmation,
withdrawal or cancellation of any objection that may be, or may have been,
made.
6. If, within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the letter of
objection, the Director-General has not received from the High Contracting
Party lodging the objection a communication stating that it has been
withdrawn, the High Contracting Party applying for registration may
request arbitration in accordance with the procedure in the following
paragraph.
7. The request for arbitration shall not be made more than one year after the
date of receipt by the Director-General of the letter of objection. Each of the
two Parties to the dispute shall appoint an arbitrator. When more than one
objection has been lodged against an application for registration, the High
Contracting Parties which have lodged the objections shall, by common
consent, appoint a single arbitrator. These two arbitrators shall select a chief
arbitrator from the international list mentioned in Article 1 of the present
Regulations. If such arbitrators cannot agree upon their choice, they shall ask
the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint a chief
arbitrator who need not necessarily be chosen from the international list. The
arbitral tribunal thus constituted shall fix its own procedure. There shall be
no appeal from its decisions.
8. Each of the High Contracting Parties may declare, whenever a dispute to
which it is a Party arises, that it does not wish to apply the arbitration
procedure provided for in the preceding paragraph. In such cases, the
objection to an application for registration shall be submitted by the
Director-General to the High Contracting Parties. The objection will be

Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization deems it essential to
convene a meeting under the powers conferred upon him by Article 27 of the
Convention. If the Director-General decides to proceed with the vote by
correspondence, he shall invite the High Contracting Parties to transmit
their votes by sealed letter within six months from the day on which they
were invited to do so.

prescribed in paragraph 1 of Article 14.

15

2. If an objection has been lodged, and without prejudice to the provision of

location, the location now envisaged, the means of transport to be used, the
route to be followed, the date proposed for the transfer, and any other

information.

Article 18. Transport abroad
Where the transfer under special protection is to the territory of another
country, it shall be governed not only by Article 12 of the Convention and by
Article 17 of the present Regulations, but by the following further
provisions:
(a) while the cultural property remains on the territory of another State,
that State shall be its depositary and shall extend to it as great a
measure of care as that which it bestows upon its own cultural
property of comparable importance;
(b) the depositary State shall return the property only on the cessation of
the conflict; such return shall be effected within six months from the
date on which it was requested;
(c) during the various transfer operations, and while it remains on the
territory of another State, the cultural property shall be exempt from
confiscation and may not be disposed of either by the depositor or by
the depositary. Nevertheless, when the safety of the property
requires it, the depositary may, with the assent of the depositor, have
the property transported to the territory of a third country, under the
conditions laid down in the present article;

whose territory the property is to be transferred accepts the

Whenever a High Contracting Party occupying territory of another High
Contracting Party transfers cultural property to a refuge situated elsewhere

as misappropriation within the meaning of Article 4 of the Convention,
provided that the Commissioner-General for Cultural Property certifies in
writing, after having consulted the usual custodians, that such transfer was
rendered necessary by circumstances.

measures recognising its exceptional cultural and historic value and
ensuring the highest level of protection;

may invite a Party to request that cultural property be included in the List.

non-governmental organisations with relevant expertise may recommend
specific cultural property to the Committee. In such cases, the Committee
may decide to invite a Party to request inclusion of that cultural property in
the List.

territory, sovereignty or jurisdiction over which is claimed by more than one
State, nor its inclusion, shall in any way prejudice the rights of the parties to
the dispute.
5. Upon receipt of a request for inclusion in the List, the Committee shall
inform all Parties of the request. Parties may submit representations
regarding such a request to the Committee within sixty days. These
representations shall be made only on the basis of the criteria mentioned in

of Article 10 sub-paragraph (b), the Committee may decide to grant
enhanced protection, provided that the requesting Party submits a request
for international assistance under Article 32.

emergency basis, enhanced protection of cultural property under its
jurisdiction or control by communicating this request to the Committee. The

conflict. In such cases the Committee will consider representations from the
Parties concerned on an expedited basis. The decision to grant provisional
enhanced protection shall be taken as soon as possible and, notwithstanding
Article 26, by a majority of four-fifths of its members present and voting.

the outcome of the regular procedure for the granting of enhanced
protection, provided that the provisions of Article 10 sub-paragraphs (a) and
(c) are met.

10. Enhanced protection shall be granted to cultural property by the
Committee from the moment of its entry in the List.
11. The Director-General shall, without delay, send to the Secretary-General

under enhanced protection by refraining from making such property the
object of attack or from any use of the property or its immediate
surroundings in support of military action.

Article 13 Loss of enhanced protection
1. Cultural property under enhanced protection shall only lose such
protection:
(a) if such protection is suspended or cancelled in accordance with
Article 14; or
(b) if, and for as long as, the property has, by its use, become a military
objective.
2. In the circumstances of sub-paragraph 1(b), such property may only be the
object of attack if:

Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill
Schedule 4 — Second Protocol

(a)
(b)
(c)

the attack is the only feasible means of terminating the use of the
property referred to in sub-paragraph 1(b);
all feasible precautions are taken in the choice of means and methods
of attack, with a view to terminating such use and avoiding, or in any
event minimising, damage to the cultural property;
unless circumstances do not permit, due to requirements of
immediate self-defence:
(i) the attack is ordered at the highest operational level of
command;
(ii) effective advance warning is issued to the opposing forces
requiring the termination of the use referred to in subparagraph 1(b); and

2. With respect to the exercise of jurisdiction and without prejudice to Article
28 of the Convention:
(a) this Protocol does not preclude the incurring of individual criminal
responsibility or the exercise of jurisdiction under national and
international law that may be applicable, or affect the exercise of
jurisdiction under customary international law;
(b) except in so far as a State which is not Party to this Protocol may
accept and apply its provisions in accordance with Article 3
paragraph 2, members of the armed forces and nationals of a State
which is not Party to this Protocol, except for those nationals serving
in the armed forces of a State which is a Party to this Protocol, do not
incur individual criminal responsibility by virtue of this Protocol,
nor does this Protocol impose an obligation to establish jurisdiction
over such persons or to extradite them.

10

15

20

25

Article 17 Prosecution
1. The Party in whose territory the alleged offender of an offence set forth in
Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c) is found to be present shall, if it does
not extradite that person, submit, without exception whatsoever and

with, if applicable, the relevant rules of international law.
2. Without prejudice to, if applicable, the relevant rules of international law,
any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connection

favorable to such person than those provided by international law.

30

35

40

1. The offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c) shall be
deemed to be included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty
existing between any of the Parties before the entry into force of this
Protocol. Parties undertake to include such offences in every extradition
treaty to be subsequently concluded between them.

45

2. When a Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a
treaty receives a request for extradition from another Party with which it has
no extradition treaty, the requested Party may, at its option, consider the

47

40

Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill
Schedule 4 — Second Protocol

present Protocol as the legal basis for extradition in respect of offences as set
forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c).
3. Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a
treaty shall recognise the offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a)
to (c) as extraditable offences between them, subject to the conditions
provided by the law of the requested Party.
4. If necessary, offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c) shall
be treated, for the purposes of extradition between Parties, as if they had
been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the
territory of the Parties that have established jurisdiction in accordance with

5

10

Article 19 Mutual legal assistance

with any treaties or other arrangements on mutual legal assistance that may

Article 20 Grounds for refusal
1. For the purpose of extradition, offences set forth in Article 15 subparagraphs 1 (a) to (c), and for the purpose of mutual legal assistance,
offences set forth in Article 15 shall not be regarded as political offences nor
as offences connected with political offences nor as offences inspired by
political motives. Accordingly, a request for extradition or for mutual legal
assistance based on such offences may not be refused on the sole ground that
it concerns a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence
or an offence inspired by political motives.
2. Nothing in this Protocol shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to
extradite or to afford mutual legal assistance if the requested Party has
substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for offences
set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c) or for mutual legal
assistance with respect to offences set forth in Article 15 has been made for
the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's
race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or that
compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person's position
for any of these reasons.

25

30

35

such legislative, administrative or disciplinary measures as may be
necessary to suppress the following acts when committed intentionally:

Protocol;

CULTURAL PROPERTY (ARMED CONFLICTS)
BILL
________________
EXPLANATORY NOTES

INTRODUCTION
1.
These explanatory notes relate to the draft Cultural Property (Armed
Conflicts) Bill which is being published in December 2007. They have been prepared
by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in order to assist the reader of the Bill
and to help inform debate on it. They do not form part of the Bill.
2.
The notes need to be read in conjunction with the Bill. They are not, and are
not meant to be, a comprehensive description of the Bill. So where a clause or part of
a clause does not seem to require any explanation or comment, none is given.
3.

The Bill extends to the whole of the UK.

BACKGROUND
4.
The Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill is designed to enable the United
Kingdom to ratify the 1954 Hague Convention for the protection of cultural property
in the event of armed conflict (the Hague Convention) and accede to its two Protocols
(1954 and 1999). The Convention, adopted following the massive destruction which
took place in the Second World War, provides for a system of general and special
protection of cultural property in situations of international and non-international
armed conflict. Parties to the Convention are required to respect both cultural property
situated within their own territory and cultural property within the territory of other
Parties, by refraining from using it, or its immediate surroundings, for purposes which
are likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict, and by
refraining from committing any hostile act against the property.
5.
It was followed by two Protocols. The first, in 1954 (the “First Protocol”),
deals with obligations in relation to cultural property in occupied territory on both the
occupying power, and countries who find cultural property which has been exported
from occupied territory in their jurisdictions. The second in 1999 (“the Second

61

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

Protocol”) extends, and clarifies the obligations under the Convention. In particular, it
identifies five acts, each a serious violation of the Protocol, which are to be
considered an offence under the Protocol.
SUMMARY
6.
Part 2 of the Bill (clauses 3 – 8) incorporates the offence created by Article 15
of the Second Protocol into domestic law, making provision in relation to ancillary
offences committed abroad, and extending criminal liability to commanders and
superiors who fail to prevent the commission of an offence in certain circumstances.
7.
Part 3 of the Bill (clauses 9 – 16) prohibits the unauthorised use of the cultural
emblem, the symbol created by the Convention to identify cultural property which is
protected under the Convention, by making it an offence to use it otherwise than as
authorised by, or under the Bill. It identifies authorised uses of the emblem, and gives
the appropriate national authority power to designate further authorised uses.
8.
Part 4 of the Bill (clauses 17 – 26) makes provision in relation to cultural
property which has been unlawfully exported from occupied territory. Clause 18
creates a new offence of dealing in such cultural property. Clauses 19 – 21 make
further provision in relation to that offence, providing for the forfeiture of the cultural
property concerned, the liability of officers of a body corporate, and giving the
Commissioner’s for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs power to investigate
offences in relation to the importation or exportation of such property. Part 4 also
provides, in clause 22, that unlawfully exported cultural property is liable to
forfeiture, and provides powers of search and seizure, and of retention of such cultural
property so that it may be returned in fulfilment of our obligation under the First
Protocol.
9.
Part 5 of the Bill (clause 27) provides immunity from seizure or forfeiture of
cultural property which is entitled to special protection under Article 12 of the
Convention because it is being transported to the UK, or through the UK to another
destination, for safekeeping during a period of armed conflict.

permission for the use of the cultural emblem in Wales, and to designate those people
who are entitled to use the cultural emblem as a means of identification. The same
powers are given to the Secretary of State, the Scottish Ministers, and the Northern
Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in relation to England, Scotland and
Northern Ireland respectively.

COMMENTARY
PART 1: KEY DEFINITIONS
Clause 1: “The Convention” and related expressions
14.
This clause provides definitions of terms used within the Act.
Clause 2: “Cultural Property”
15.
This defines ‘cultural property’ by reference to the definition given in Article
1 of the Convention. Article 1, with the rest of the Convention, is set out in Schedule
1 to the Bill. The definition is:
”(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage
of every people, such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether
religious or secular; archaeological sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole,

63
3

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

are of historical or artistic interest; works of art; manuscripts, books and other
objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as scientific
collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of
the property defined above;
(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the
movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large
libraries and depositories of archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the
event of armed conflict, the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph
(a) above;
(c) centres containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in subparagraphs (a) and (b), to be known as "centres containing monuments".”
PART 2: SERIOUS BREACH OF THE SECOND PROTOCOL
Clause 3: Offence of serious breach of Second Protocol
16.
Subsection (1) sets out the elements of the offence created in this clause. An
offence is committed where a person intentionally does one of the five acts listed in
Article 15(1) of the Second Protocol, which is set out in Schedule 4 to the Bill,
knowing or having reason to suspect that the property which has, for example, been
made the object of attack is cultural property. In addition, the act concerned must be a
violation of the Convention or the Second Protocol. Action taken by the armed forces
of a country which is not a party to the Convention or the Second Protocol, and is not
therefore bound by the obligations set out in the Convention and the Protocol, will not
amount to an offence under this clause, as it cannot be a violation of the Convention
or the Second Protocol. Article 16(2)(b) of the Second Protocol makes it clear,
subject to one exception set out in that article, that members of the armed forces and
nationals of a State which is not a Party to that Protocol do not incur individual
criminal responsibility by virtue of the Second Protocol unless they are serving in the
armed forces of a State which is a Party to the Protocol.
17.
Subsection (2) makes it clear that an act which is done in another country may
be an offence under this clause.
18.
Subsection (3) ensures that someone can be prosecuted whether or not they are
a UK national, in relation to the first three acts listed in Article 15 of the Second
Protocol. Under Article 16(1) of the Second Protocol, we are required to establish our
jurisdiction over anyone who has made cultural property under enhanced protection
the object of attack, or used such cultural property or its immediate surrounds in
support of military action, or who is guilty of extensive destruction or appropriation of
protected cultural property, where they are present in the UK. This applies regardless
of the nationality of the person concerned, or the amount of time for which they are

64
4

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

present in this country. Accordingly, subsection (3) provides that an offence in
relation to these acts may be committed by someone of any nationality (though, as
noted above, this is subject to Article 16(2)(b) of the Second Protocol).
19.
Article 16(1) requires a less extensive jurisdiction to be taken over offenders
who have made cultural property which is protected under the Convention, but is not
entitled to enhanced protection, the object of attack, or who have been guilty of theft,
pillage or misappropriation of protected cultural property, or acts of vandalism against
such property. Subsection (4) therefore provides that an offence in relation to these
acts is only committed where the person concerned is a UK national or subject to UK
service jurisdiction.
20.
Subsections (5) and (6) define the terms “UK national” and “person subject to
UK jurisdiction” for the purposes of this clause.
Clause 4: Ancillary offences
21.
Subsection (1) makes it clear that an ancillary offence to the offence of serious
breach of the Second Protocol provided for in clause 3 may be committed in a country
outside the United Kingdom, provided that the perpetrator could have been prosecuted
had he committed the main offence. So, where the offence concerned is ancillary to
the acts listed in Article 15(1)(d) or 15(1)(e) of the Second Protocol, the perpetrator
may only be prosecuted if he is a UK national, or subject to UK service jurisdiction.
If the offence is ancillary to the acts listed in Article 15(1)(a), 15(1)(b) or 15(1)(c), a
perpetrator of any nationality may be prosecuted (provided that he is not within the
terms of Article 16(2)(b)).
22.
Subsections (2), (3), and (4) define what is meant by “an offence that is
ancillary to an offence under section 3” in relation to each of the jurisdictions in the
United Kingdom.
23.
Subsection (5) ensures that the provision made in relation to ancillary offences
applies in relation to offences which are not ancillary to the principal offence, but to
an offence which is itself an ancillary offence. This would apply, for example, where
someone has accepted money for the purpose of concealing an attempt to commit the
principal offence. He would be guilty of an offence under section 5 of the Criminal
Law Act 1967, which is ancillary to the offence of attempt to commit the offence of
serious breach of the Second Protocol, which is also an ancillary offence.
Clause 5: Responsibility of commanders and other superiors
24.
This clause provides for an additional form of criminal responsibility, namely
that of commanders and superiors for the acts of their subordinates. This concept is
one of the recognised general principles of international law referred to in Article 15.2
of the Second Protocol. The Statute of the International Criminal Court was accepted

65
5

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

during the negotiations on the Second Protocol as an authoritative restatement of the
general principles of international law in relation to criminal liability, and the wording
of the section is based on Article 28 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court
(similar provision is made in section 65 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001),
and, as subsection (6) makes clear, courts will be obliged to take account of the
jurisprudence of the International Criminal Court in interpreting and applying this
clause.
25.
The wording in subsections (2) and (4) draws a distinction between the
standards expected of military and quasi-military commanders in relation to military
forces under their command, and other superiors such as government officials or
heads of civilian organisations, as it is recognised that the latter may not have the
same degree of control over the actions of their subordinates. The commander will
incur liability under this provision where he knew, or owing to the circumstances at
the time should have known, that his forces were committing an offence. A superior
will only be liable where he or she knew or consciously disregarded information
indicating that the subordinate was committing as offence.
26.
Subsections (1) and (7) make it clear that liability under this provision is a
form of aiding and abetting and that it does not preclude any criminal liability which
arises apart from this clause. Under section 8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act
1861, a person who has aided or abetted the commission of an offence is liable to be
prosecuted, and is subject to the same penalty, as a principal offender.
Clause 6: Liability of company officers for offences by company
27.
Where an offence has been committed by a body corporate, this clause ensures
that it is possible to prosecute officers of a corporate body as well as the body
concerned where the commission of the offence by that body was due to their
negligence, or they have consented to, or connived at, the commission of the offence.
Clause 7: Penalties
28.
This clause provides for the maximum penalty for the offence of serious
breach of the Second Protocol, and for offences which are ancillary to such offences.
Clause 8: Attorney General’s consent to prosecutions
29.
This clause ensures that prosecutions for the offence of serious breach of the
Second Protocol, or for related ancillary offences may not be brought in England and
Wales without the consent of the Attorney General. In Northern Ireland, the consent
of the Advocate General is required.

66

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

PART 3: CULTURAL EMBLEM
Clause 9: The emblem
30.
This clause defines the cultural emblem introduced by the Convention to
identify cultural property which is protected under that Convention. The Secretary of
State is given power to make a statutory instrument which will set out both the
cultural emblem, and the cultural emblem triangle. The permitted uses of these
emblems are set out in Article 17 of the Convention, and this is reflected in Part 3 of
the Bill.
Clause 10: Offence of unauthorised use
31.
This clause creates a new offence, of unauthorised use of the cultural emblem.
It is also an offence to use another design which is capable of being mistaken for the
emblem because it so closely resembles it. The offence is punishable by a fine, and
proceedings may only be brought with the consent of the Director of Public
Prosecutions in England and Wales, or for Northern Ireland.
Clause 11: Use authorised by the appropriate national authority
32.
Subsection (1) gives to the appropriate national authority the power to give
permission for particular uses of the cultural emblem as being “authorised” for the
purposes of this part of the Bill. “Appropriate national authority” is defined in clause
16 of the Bill as the Secretary of State, in relation to England, and the devolved
authorities in the other parts of the United Kingdom. Permission which has been given
may be withdrawn. Subsection (2) imposes an additional requirement where the
cultural property concerned is immovable cultural property. In this case, a copy of the
permission given must be displayed with the emblem.
Clause 12: Other authorised use: movable property
33.
This clause identifies uses of the cultural emblem, and the cultural emblem
triangle, which are authorised in relation to movable cultural property.
Clause 13: Other authorised use: personnel
34.
This clause authorises the use of the cultural emblem to identify two classes of
people. The first class consists of those personnel who have duties of control under
the Convention in relation to cultural property, such as the representative for cultural
property appointed under Article 2 of the Regulations, or the Commissioner-General
for Cultural Property who must be appointed to Parties to the Convention engaged in
armed conflict. The second class consists of personnel who have been designated by
the appropriate national authority as being engaged in the property of cultural
property in the appropriate part of the United Kingdom.

67
7

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

Clause 14: Defences
35.
This clause sets out three defences to the offence of unauthorised use. Under
subsection (2) it is not an offence to use the cultural emblem for a purpose for which it
had previously been lawfully used by the accused before this clause comes into force.
36.
Under subsection (3) it is not an offence to use the emblem where it forms part
of a trademark which was registered before the clause comes into force, and the
trademark is being used lawfully in relation to the goods or services for which it was
registered.
37.
Under subsections (4) and (5) it is not an offence to use a design on goods
provided that the design was applied to the goods by their manufacturer or someone
trading in those goods before they came into the possession of the accused, and the
person applying the design was using it lawfully in relation to the same type of goods
before the section came into force. Use of the emblem by the manufacturer or trader
would come within the terms of the defences set out in subsections (2) and (3) of this
clause. The defence in subsections (4) and (5) is intended to ensure that the purchaser
of such goods does not commit an offence.
Clause 15: Forfeiture
38.
This clause gives the court which convicts someone of the offence of
unauthorised use of the emblem the power to order the forfeiture of the articles in
respect of which the offence was committed, and where appropriate, their destruction.
Clause 16: “Appropriate national authority”
39.
This clause defines the term “appropriate national authority” in relation to
each part of the United Kingdom. That term is used in clauses 11 and 13 of the Bill.
PART 4: PROPERTY EXPORTED FROM OCCUPIED TERRITORY
40.
Under the First Protocol to the Convention, the United Kingdom is under an
obligation to take cultural property which has been exported from occupied territory
and imported into the United Kingdom into its custody, and to return that property to
the competent authorities at the close of hostilities. Further, under Article 21 of the
Second Protocol, the United Kingdom is obliged to take measures to suppress any
illicit export, other removal or transfer of ownership of cultural property from
occupied territory in violation of the Convention or the Second Protocol. This Part of
the Bill is intended to enable the government to implement those obligations.
Clause 17: “Unlawfully exported cultural property” &c
41.
This clause states what is meant by “unlawfully exported cultural property” for
the purposes of this Part of the Bill. The cultural property in question must have been

68
8

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

exported from occupied territory, and its export must have been unlawful under either
the laws of the territory in question, or under rules of international law such as the
First Protocol. The unlawful export need not have taken place after this Bill came
into force – cultural property unlawfully exported from occupied territory at any time
after the First Protocol came into force, may come within the definition of
“unlawfully exported cultural property”. So, for example, outstanding icons stolen
from church in an occupied territory in the 1970s and smuggled out of that territory
would fall within the definition of “unlawfully exported cultural property”.
42.
Under subsection (3) it is made clear that the test for “occupied territory” is
drawn from Article 42 of the 1907 Hague Regulations respecting the Laws and
Customs of War on Land. Under that provision “Territory is considered occupied
when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army. The occupation
applies only to territory where such authority is established and in a position to assert
itself.”
43.
Under subsection (4) provides that, where a certificate is given by the
Secretary of State as to whether or not particular territory is occupied territory, that
certificate will be conclusive evidence of that fact. However, such a certificate need
not be given in all cases. Alternative evidence may be provided to prove the status of
a particular territory.
Clause 18: Offence of dealing in unlawfully exported cultural property
44.
Subsection (1) makes it an offence to deal in cultural property which has been
unlawfully exported from occupied if the perpetrator either knew or had reason to
suspect that the cultural property concerned had been unlawfully exported. The
prosecution will have to prove that the property satisfied the definition of “cultural
property” given in Article 1 of the Convention, but it will not be necessary to show
that the perpetrator was aware of this.
45.
Subsection (2) ensures that an offence is only committed where the property
concerned was imported into the United Kingdom after the commencement of this
clause. “Import” for these purposes includes any way in which the property is
brought into the United Kingdom. No offence will be committed in relation to
cultural property which is not imported into the United Kingdom.
46.
Subsections (3), (4) and (5) define “dealing” for the purpose of this section,
identifying each of the activities which may result in the commission of an offence.
Although many agreements regarding dishonest dealing in an object will be covered
by the law of conspiracy, subsection (3)(b) ensures that where, for example, A and B
make an agreement to acquire unlawfully exported cultural property, and B does not
have the requisite knowledge, A can still be prosecuted for this offence.

69
9

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

47.
Under Subsections (6) and (7) the offence will be triable either way. Where
the accused is convicted in the crown court, the maximum penalty will be
imprisonment for a term of seven years, or a fine (under the Criminal Justice Act
2003, section 163, someone convicted of an offence in the crown court may be given
a fine instead of, or in addition to, a sentence of imprisonment). Where the accused is
convicted in the magistrates’ court the maximum penalty will be imprisonment for a
term of 12 months, or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum (currently £5,000).
Section 282 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 increases the maximum sentence of
imprisonment which may be imposed by the Magistrates Court to 12 months.
Subsection (7)(a) ensures that the same sentence may be imposed before section 282
comes into force.
Clause 19: Forfeiture in connection with dealing offence.
48.
This clause ensures that, where someone has been convicted of the offence of
dealing with unlawfully exported cultural property, the court may order the forfeiture
of that property, and may make further provision for its retention or disposal.
Clause 20: Liability of company officers for offences by company.
49.
Similarly to clause 6, this clause ensures that, where the offence of dealing
with unlawfully exported cultural property has been committed by a body corporate, it
is possible to prosecute officers of a corporate body as well as the body concerned
where the commission of the offence by that body was due to their negligence, or they
have consented to, or connived at, the commission of the offence.
Clause 21: Revenue and customs prosecutions
50.
This clause provides for the Commissioner’s for Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs to conduct investiagtions in relation to the offence of dealing with
unlawfully exported cultural property where the dealing concerned took the form of
the importation or exportation of the cultural property in question.
Clause 22: Property liable to forfeiture
51.
This clause makes cultural property which has been unlawfully exported from
occupied territory liable to forfeiture, provided that it has been imported into the
United Kingdom after the clause comes into force, whether or not a criminal offence
has been committed in relation to the cultural property in question. The procedure
which must be followed to obtain the forfeiture of cultural property is set out in
Schedule 5 to the Bill.
Clause 23: Search and seizure warrants.
52.
This clause ensures that the police may apply to a justice of the peace for a
warrant authorising them to enter the premises identified in the warrant in order to
search for cultural property which has been unlawfully exported from occupied
territory, and where such property is discovered as a result of the search, that they

70
10

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

may seize it. The police must be able to demonstrate to the justice of the peace that
there are reasonable grounds for believing that such cultural property is situated in the
premises in question. The issue of a warrant under this clause is subject to the
safeguards set out in section 15 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, and
must be executed in accordance with the requirements in section 16 of that Act.
Subsection (3) provides that someone exercising a power under such a warrant has
authority to use reasonable force where this is necessary, for example, to gain access
to the premises in question, or to open locked storage space.
53.
Once cultural property has been seized under this provision, it must be
retained by the police until the procedure set out in Schedule 5 has been followed.
54.
Subsection (5) ensures that the additional powers of seizure provided for by
section 50 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 will apply. Where a person
searching premises under the authority of a warrant issued under this clause discovers
material which he has reasonable grounds for believing may contain cultural property
which he is entitled to seize, but it is not reasonably practicable for this to be
determined on the premises themselves, that material, or as much of it as is necessary
to decide the matter, may be removed for examination elsewhere.
Clause 24: Retention of property in the custody of a constable.
55.
This clause gives a justice of the peace power to authorise the continued
retention of property which was originally seized in connection with the investigation
or prosecution of the offence of dealing in unlawfully exported cultural property, on
the application of a constable. This may happen, for example, where cultural property
was originally seized as evidence in relation to an offence of dealing in unlawfully
exported cultural property, but either it is decided that no criminal proceedings should
be brought, or any criminal proceedings brought result in the acquittal of the accused,
so that the power under which the police originally seized that property no longer
applies.
56.
Under subsection (2), an application for such an order may be made by a
constable. Once retention of the property has been authorised, it must be retained by
the police until it has been dealt with under the provisions of Schedule 5.
57.
Subsection (3) sets out the grounds on which an order for continued retention
may be made. The justice of the peace must be satisfied that there are reasonable
grounds for suspecting that the property may be liable to forfeiture under clause 22.
Property is liable to forfeiture under that clause where it is cultural property within the
meaning of the Convention, it has been unlawfully exported from occupied territory,
and it was imported into the UK after the commencement of clause 22.

58.
Subsection (4) provides that it is lawful for property to be retained by a
constable pending the making of a determination by a justice of the peace under
subsection (2), or in accordance with an order made by a justice under subsection (3).
59.
Subsection (5) disapplies the Police (Property) Act 1897, and the related Act
under the law of Northern Ireland, which make provision with respect to the disposal
of property in the possession of the police.
Clause 25: Retention of property in custody of Revenue and Customs
60.
This clause applies the previous clause (clause 24) to property in the custody
of an officer of Revenue and Customs or a member of the Revenue and Customs
Prosecutions office in the same way as it applies to property in the custody of a
constable. For this purpose, references to a constable in clause 24 are modified
accordingly.
Clause 26: Property in the custody of others
61.
Under subsection (2) property originally seized in connection with the
investigation or prosecution of an offence which is held by anyone other than the
police or a person mentioned in clause 25 must be transferred to the custody of the
police once it ceases to be needed for that purpose. This will enable the police to
make an application for the continued retention of the property.

Schedule 5: Unlawfully Exported Cultural Property: Forfeiture
62.
Where property has been seized under clause 23 or is retained in accordance
with an order made under clause 24 or 25 of this Bill, paragraphs 2 and 3 require
notice to be given to the person believed by the police or HMRC to be the owner of
cultural property which is being seized, and make provision in relation to that notice.
63.
Paragraph 4 gives the Secretary of State power to make an application to the
High Court, or, in relation to Scotland, to the Court of Session, for the forfeiture of
cultural property which has been unlawfully exported from occupied territory. In
respect of property seized under clause 23, such an application must be made no later
than four months from the date on which either the cultural property was seized. In
respect of property retained in pursuance of an order made under clause 24 or 25 of
the Bill, such an application must be made within four months beginning with the date
on which the order was made. If no application is made within that period, the
cultural property must be returned to its owner as defined in paragraph 9 of Schedule
5. Forfeiture of the cultural property will only be granted where the Secretary of State
is able to prove that the property concerned is cultural property within the meaning of
the Convention and that it was in fact unlawfully exported from occupied territory
within the meaning of clause 17 of the Bill.

72
12

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

64.
Paragraph 5 gives the court power to award compensation to a person
provided that it is satisfied that that person acquired the cultural property concerned
both in good faith, and without knowledge of the fact that it had been unlawfully
exported from occupied territory. If the court does make a compensation assessment,
the compensation which has been assessed to be due must be paid before the
forfeiture order can take effect. Compensation may be paid by the authorities who are
seeking the return of the cultural property in question, or by the Secretary of State. If
the compensation due has not been paid within four months of the date on which the
forfeiture order was made, the order ceases to have any effect, and the cultural
property concerned must be returned to its owner as defined in paragraph 9 of
Schedule 5.
65.
Paragraph 6 gives the court power to make interim orders which are
considered to be appropriate for the safekeeping of the property. For example, where
cultural property is in a fragile condition, requiring work to stabilise it, the court
would be able to order that it should be transferred to the custody of a museum for the
necessary conservation work to be carried out.
66.
Under paragraph 7 where a forfeiture order is made, the Secretary of State is
under a duty to ensure that the cultural property concerned is returned in accordance
with the United Kingdom’s obligations under the First Protocol to the Hague
Convention. Under paragraph 3 of that Protocol, such cultural property must be
returned, at the close of hostilities, to the competent authorities of the territory
previously occupied.
67.
Paragraph 8 of Schedule 5, as noted above, imposes a duty on the person who
has custody of cultural property which has been seized to return it to the owner, as
soon as reasonably practicable, unless a forfeiture order has been made, and has come
into effect. The only exception to this duty applies, under subparagraph (3) where
the person who has custody has been unable to return the cultural property to its
owner within a period of twelve months. In this case, that person may dispose of it as
they think appropriate.
PART 5: PROPERTY REMOVED FOR SAFEKEEPING
Clause 27: Immunity from seizure or forfeiture
68.
Under Article 14 of the Convention, the United Kingdom is required to grant
immunity from seizure to any cultural property which enjoys special protection under
Article 12 of the Convention. This applies to transports of cultural property which are
being removed from their original territory for safekeeping, and in accordance with
the conditions set out in the Regulations for the Execution of the Convention (set out
in Schedule 2 to the Bill). Clause 27 of the Bill ensures that such cultural property
may not be seized or forfeited while it is in the United Kingdom.

73
13

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

69.
As subsections (3) and (4) make clear, the immunity applies both to cultural
property which is being transported to the United Kingdom, and to cultural property
which is in transit through the United Kingdom en route to another destination for
safekeeping. In the case of cultural property which is being transported to the United
Kingdom, for which the United Kingdom has agreed to act as depositary accepting the
obligations under Regulation 18 of the Regulations for the Execution of the
Convention, subsection (5) provides that the cultural property is protected while it
remains in the custody of the Secretary of State, or any other person or institution
which has been made responsible for the safekeeping of the cultural property by the
Secretary of State. If the cultural property leaves the custody of such an institution- as
where it is stolen, it is no longer protected, and may be seized by the police so that it
can be returned to the institution in question.
70.
Subsection (7) ensures that the same protection applies to any vehicle which is
being used to transport cultural property protected under Article 12 of the Convention.
71.
Subsection (8) clarifies the extent of the protection which will be given to
objects under this clause. It includes immunity against all forms of execution which
might be made against an object protected under the clause, any order made in civil
proceedings and any measure taken in criminal proceedings (or for the purposes of a
criminal investigation) which might affect the control or custody of an object. The
protection given is intended to exclude any form of seizure or detention of an object
lent to an exhibition in this country whether by a claimant to the object, a creditor or
by law enforcement authorities.
PART 6: GENERAL
Clause 28: Commencement
72.
This clause gives the Secretary of State power to specify the commencement
dates for the provisions of the Bill by order.
Clause 29: Extent
73.
By virtue of clause 27 the Bill will extend throughout the United Kingdom. In
addition, under subsection (2), by Order in Council, its provisions can be extended to
cover any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and any British overseas territory.
Clause 30: Crown Application
74.
This clause applies the provisions contained in the Bill including enforcement
powers such as powers of entry to public servants and activities and premises carried
out or used by or on behalf of the Crown. The Bill will not, however, apply to the
Queen in her private capacity.

FINANCIAL EFFECTS
75.
The financial effects to Consolidated fund and National Loans Fund of this
Act should be negligible. The only areas of additional expenditure likely to be
incurred are through enforcement (it is not foreseen that these will be significant) and
through compensating good faith purchasers of property which is to be returned to its
country of origin.
PUBLIC SERVICE MANPOWER
76.
The Bill does not require significant changes to public service manpower. The
proposals in it should be met within existing resources.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT
77.
An Impact Assessment has been published on the DCMS website, at [link].
The sectors who may incur costs under this legislation are the enforcement authorities
and central government (for which costs will be dependent on prosecutions and how
much cultural property needs to be seized and returned) and dealers in cultural
property, who will need to undertake due diligence checks into cultural property they
propose to acquire to ensure that it has not been unlawfully exported from occupied
territory. We do not expect these costs to be substantial.
78.
The Bill will produce significant non-monetarised benefits, codifying the
system by which the UK military protects cultural property when operating abroad,
the introduction of the emblem for identifying objects and structures of cultural
importance, and the return of objects illegally removed from occupied territories
EUROPEAN CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
79.
Section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the Minister in charge of a
Bill in either House of Parliament to make a statement about the compatibility of the
provisions of the Bill with the Convention rights protected by the Human Rights Act.
We believe that the Minister will be able to make the following statement “In my
view the provisions of the Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill are compatible
with the Convention rights.”
80.
Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill introduce new criminal offences. These offences
do not raise any issues under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights

75
15

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

(“ECHR”). They do not impose any burden of proof on the defendant, or in any way
restrict the guarantees of a fair trial provided under Article 6 of the ECHR.
81.
Under Article 7 of the ECHR, offences must be based in law, which is
sufficiently accessible, and the effects of which are reasonably foreseeable, so that an
individual is able to foresee the consequences of his actions. The provisions relating
to each offence are readily accessible in the Bill. The Part 2 offence is defined by
reference to the acts defined as “offences” in Article 15(1) of the Second Protocol.
That article, with the other provisions of the Protocol and Conventions, are set out in
full in Schedules to the Bill. It is also clear from the offences what conduct will
amount to an offence. Accordingly, these provisions comply with the requirements of
Article 7 of the ECHR.
82.
Part 4 of the Bill includes powers of entry, search and seizure in relation to
unlawfully exported cultural property which restrict the right under Article 8 of the
convention to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence. These
powers are being introduced in pursuance of a legitimate aim – the protection of the
cultural heritage of occupied territories, and the implementation of the United
Kingdom’s obligations under international law. They seek to meet a real and pressing
need – the extent of the looting to which the cultural heritage of an occupied territory
may be subject has recently been illustrated in Iraq, and they are a proportionate
response to that aim. The power to issue warrants authorising entry, search and
seizure is subject to judicial supervision and attended by the safeguards set out in
sections 15 and 16 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. We consider that
these provisions satisfy the requirements of Article 8 of the ECHR.
83.
Part 4 of the Bill provides for the forfeiture of cultural property which has
been unlawfully exported from occupied territory, even where an offence has been
committed under English law in relation to that property. This restricts rights under
Article 1, Protocol 1 to the ECHR to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions, by
authorising a deprivation of possessions. It is however justified as being in the public
interest, subject to condition provided for by law and striking, we believe, a fair
balance between the demands of the community and the rights of the individual
owner.
84.
The provisions are an integral part of the procedure being introduced to enable
the repatriation of unlawfully exported cultural property. No cultural property may be
forfeited without an application to the court by the Secretary of State, which will give
the owner of that property an opportunity to contest the fact that it has been
unlawfully excavated, and to apply for compensation where he can demonstrate that
the property was acquired in good faith without knowledge of the fact that it was
unlawfully excavated from occupied territory. The amount of compensation due to the
owner will be assessed by the court, which will be able to take account of all the

76
16

These notes refer to the draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill

circumstances, including the conduct of the owner, and where appropriate, award the
full market value of the property to the owner. If compensation is awarded, the
forfeiture order cannot take effect until the compensation has actually been paid.. We
do not therefore consider that these provisions contravene Article 1, Protocol 1 to the
ECHR.
85.
Part 5 of the Bill, which provides for immunity from seizure in relation to
certain cultural property engages rights under Article 1, Protocol 1, and Article 6 of
the ECHR. The immunity applies to cultural property which has special protection
under the Hague Convention and is in transit through the United Kingdom to another
country, or for which the United Kingdom has agreed to act as the depositary,
responsible for the safekeeping of the cultural property in question during an armed
conflict. Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable
time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination
of his civil rights and obligations. The proposed immunity will not prevent potential
claimants from bringing a claim to protected cultural property before the courts, but it
will prevent the courts from granting seizure or restitution of the property concerned
as a remedy for such a claim. Other remedies, including the award of damages, will
be available, and we consider that this limitation is a proportionate restriction on the
right of access to the court under Article 6. In addition, the immunity is temporary in
nature. Where cultural property is in transit though the United Kingdom, the
immunity is unlikely to last for more than a few days. Where the United Kingdom
has agreed to act as depositary under the Convention for cultural property the
immunity will apply while the cultural property is in the UK, which will be limited to
the duration of the conflict in question. The government will be able to make
enquiries into the provenance of the cultural property before it agrees to accept it for
safekeeping, which will limit the risk that cultural property whose ownership is
disputed will be brought into the United Kingdom. We do not consider that the
immunity contravenes the provisions of Article 6. For the same reasons, we consider
that the immunity is in the public interest in preserving cultural property which, under
the terms of the Hague Convention must be “of great importance to the cultural
heritage of every people”, and that it strikes a fair balance between the interests of
potential claimants and the public interest. Accordingly, it does not contravene
Article 1, Protocol 1 to the ECHR.

What is the problem under consideration? Why is government intervention necessary?
In 2004 the Government announced its intention to ratify the 1954 Hague Convention for the
Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and accede to its two Protocols (of 1954
and 1999). The Convention requires the creation of new criminal offences for serious violations of the
Convention; the suppression of trade in, and return of, cultural property unlawfully exported from
occupied territory; protection of the blue shield emblem; and immunity from seizure for certain cultural
property. This Bill is necessary to satisfy these obligations.
What are the policy objectives and the intended effects?
The principal objective is to ensure that the UK is able to protect cultural property, both in the UK and
internationally, in the event of armed conflict. The Bill will put in place measures to protect cultural
property in the event of armed conflict; enable seizure and return of cultural property unlawfully
removed from occupied territory and prosecute those knowingly dealing in such material. It also
creates an offence of unauthorised use of the blue shield emblem and provides immunity from
seizure for the cultural property of other States moved for safekeeping to the UK.

What policy options have been considered? Please justify any preferred option.
DCMS, in partnership with other interested Government departments, considered two options:
1) Introduce legislation to enable ratification of the Convention and accession to its two Protocols; or
2) Ratify and accede without introducing legislation.
It was considered that to ratify without introducing legislation would run a significant risk of the UK
being in breach of its obligations under the Convention and being both exposed to international
censure and subject to domestic judicial review.
When will the policy be reviewed to establish the actual costs and benefits and the
achievement of the desired effects?
A review of the legislation will take place after 5 years.
Ministerial Sign-off For final proposal/implementation stage Impact Assessments:
I have read the Impact Assessment and I am satisfied that, given the available
evidence, it represents a reasonable view of the likely costs, benefits and impact of
the leading options.

Evidence Base
The Convention
The UK Government publicly announced its intention to ratify the 1954 Hague Convention and
accede to both its Protocols in May 2004, on the 50th anniversary of the Convention.
The Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (the
Hague Convention) was signed at The Hague on 14 May 1954. The Convention provides for a
system of general and special protection of cultural property in situations of international and
non-international armed conflict.
Cultural property for this purpose is defined as movable and immovable property of great importance
to the cultural heritage of every people (the full definition is rather lengthy but is set out in Article
1 of the Convention). The Convention is supplemented by two Protocols – the first adopted at the
same time as the Convention, in 1954, and the second adopted in 1999 (the Second Protocol).
Obligations under the Convention
Parties to the Convention are required to respect cultural property situated within their own
territory as well as within the territory of other Parties, by refraining from using the property, the
appliances in use for its protection or its immediate surroundings for purposes which are likely
to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict, and by refraining from
committing any hostile act against the property. They are also required to take measures in peace
time to safeguard their cultural property in the event of armed conflict. Some measures which
should be taken are identified in the 1999 Protocol. It is not required to make the failure to take
these safeguarding measures a criminal offence.
The Convention also prescribes a distinctive emblem which may be used to identify cultural
property protected by the Convention, whose use is voluntary. States Parties are required to
prevent the abuse of that emblem.
The Convention also makes provision for transports of cultural property to receive special
protection. This is aimed at the situation where a country wishes to move its national cultural
treasures out of harm’s way in the event of actual or potential armed conflict. The obligations laid
on States Parties in relation to such protected transports include an obligation to grant immunity
from “capture, seizure or taking in prize” to both the cultural property and the means of transport.
Obligations under the 1954 Protocol
The 1954 Protocol imposes a number of obligations on States Parties in relation to the protection
of cultural property in occupied territories. State Parties must undertake to prevent the export of
cultural property from territory occupied by it and to take into its custody cultural property
imported into its territory either directly or indirectly from any occupied territory. At the end of
the occupation, each Party is obliged to return any cultural property in its territory that was
illegally exported from the occupied State and refrain from retaining it as war reparations.
Obligations under the 1999 Protocol
The 1999 Protocol introduces, among other things, a new system of enhanced protection which
is designed to replace the original, and generally accepted as flawed, system of special protection.
It clarifies the definition of certain terms, such as “military objective” and “military necessity”
and it introduces five specific acts which need to be criminalised by State Parties. These are set
out in Article 15(1) and are as follows:
(a) making cultural property under enhanced protection the object of attack;
(b) using cultural property under enhanced protection or its immediate surroundings in
support of military action;
(c) extensive destruction or appropriation of cultural property protected under the
Convention and this Protocol;

83

(d) making cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol the object of
attack;
(e) theft, pillage or misappropriation of, or acts of vandalism directed against cultural
property protected under the Convention.

Why Ratify the Convention now?
The UK decided not to ratify the Convention when it was first drafted because, along with a
number of other countries, it considered that certain terms were too imprecise and that it did not
provide an effective regime for the protection of cultural property. The adoption of the Second
Protocol in 1999, however, has removed the concerns previously expressed by the UK over the
Convention.
It is felt that ratification of the Convention will have two primary benefits for the UK:
G

it will formalise the responsibilities of UK troops when operating in armed conflict
overseas with regard to the protection of cultural property; and

G

it will provide reciprocal protection for UK cultural property in the event that we were
attacked by a State party to the Convention.

A copy of the Convention, Regulations and the two Protocols can be downloaded from the
website of the United National Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) at
www.unesco.org.

Considering the options
The rationale behind why the UK selected the option of ratifying the Convention (as opposed to
choosing not to ratify) is spelt out in the section above. The next set of options considered was
whether introducing primary legislation was necessary to enable the UK to fulfil our obligations
under the Convention. On balance it was felt that our obligations could not be met through the
existing suite of cultural property legislation and that a new Bill was necessary. The reasoning
behind that decision is spelt out below.

Need for UK legislation
The Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill introduces a number of measures designed to allow
the UK to fulfil its obligations under the Convention and its two Protocols. The Bill includes the
following:
G

It introduces offences (originally laid out in the 2nd Protocol) which are designed to
protect cultural property (the Bill utilises the definition of cultural property included in
the Convention) in the event of an armed conflict. These include making such property
the object of attack, or its immediate surroundings, an offence.

G

It introduces the Blue Shield, as an emblem that signifies cultural property protected
under the Convention and its two Protocols. The emblem can (its use is voluntary) be
affixed to protected cultural property. In addition to the emblem, the DCMS will be
utilising other means of signifying protected cultural property (for which primary
legislation is not necessary).

G

It introduces a legal regime which makes it illegal to deal in cultural property illegally
exported from occupied territory and allows such property to be seized and returned to
a competent authority in the occupied territory after the close of hostilities, where
appropriate.
It introduces immunity from seizure for cultural property in the UK which is being
transported for safekeeping during a conflict between two or more other States.

G

The justification for the inclusion of these provisions is as follows:
Offences related to protection of cultural property during armed conflict

84

Existing English offences in relation to the Second Protocol offences are judged to be insufficient
for the following reasons:
(a) The behaviour which article 15(1)(a) and (d) seeks to criminalise (making cultural
property the object of attack) is partially covered by existing offences under section 1(1)
of the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 (via Article 85(4)(d) of the First Protocol to the
Geneva Conventions) and section 51 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 (via
Article 8(2)(b)(ix) of the Statute of the ICC). However, neither offence is sufficient:
(i) in neither case is the definition of the property protected sufficient to encompass
attacks directed at all forms of cultural property, as defined in Article 1 of the Hague
Convention;
(ii) the offences are more restricted than the offences under Article 15(1) of the 1999
Protocol.
(b) There is no equivalent offence for Article 15(1)(b) of the 1999 Protocol (using cultural
property under enhanced protection in support of military action);
(c) A breach of Article 8(2)(b)(xiii) of the ICC Statute is a criminal offence under section 51
of the International Criminal Court Act 2001. This offence, though not specifically
directed at cultural property would cover the behaviour criminalised under Article
15(1)(c). However, it does not apply in relation to non-international conflicts; and the
jurisdiction we have taken to prosecute this offence is not sufficiently wide to meet our
obligations under Article 16 of the 1999 Protocol.
(d) There are also a number of existing offences in domestic law which could be used to
prosecute the behaviour covered by Article 15(1)(e), where the relevant acts take place
within the United Kingdom, or were committed by someone subject to naval discipline
or to military or air force law. Article 15(1)(e) is one of the offences for which a more
limited jurisdiction is required – we would only have to establish jurisdiction over this
offence where the offence is committed within the territory of the United Kingdom, or
by a United Kingdom national. However, our jurisdiction to prosecute United Kingdom
nationals for the existing domestic offences committed outside the United Kingdom only
applies where they are subject to military discipline, or in the service of the Crown and
acting (or purporting to act) in the course of their employment. This is not sufficient even
to satisfy the more restricted jurisdictional requirements for this offence. For example, it
would not enable the United Kingdom to prosecute a United Kingdom national for
anything done as a member of a private company offering security services in another
country in the context of an armed conflict.
Offences related to the Blue Shield
Protection is already given under English law to the Red Cross and its related emblems. Section
6(1) of the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 provides that use of the protected emblems for any
purpose without the authority of the Secretary of State is unlawful. Subsection (2) also makes it
unlawful to use any design which so nearly resembles the protected signs that it is capable of
being mistaken for the sign in question without the authority of the Secretary of State.
The Blue Shield emblem, however, cannot be regarded as a related emblem to the Red Cross
and is not covered by the Geneva Conventions Act 1957. The provisions of the Bill, therefore,
are designed to give the cultural emblem equivalent protection to the red cross and the red
crescent.

The protection of cultural property from occupied territory
The 1954 Protocol imposes obligations on Occupying States and other Parties to take measures
to suppress any illicit export of cultural property from occupied territory, to take into its custody
any cultural property which has been imported from any occupied territory, whether directly
from the territory concerned, or indirectly via another country and to return any cultural property
protected by the Convention which is in their territories at the end of hostilities. Other obligations
are imposed on Occupying States to safeguard cultural property in the occupied territory, and to
refrain from archaeological exploration there.
There are already some offences which may apply where cultural property has been exported
from occupied territory. The Dealing in Cultural Objects (Offences) Act 2003 makes it an offence
to deal dishonestly in a cultural object which is “tainted”. The definition of “tainted” in that Act
is limited to objects which were removed or excavated after 30 December 2003 (the date of
commencement of the Act) where the removal or excavation constituted an offence. The fact that
an object has been illegally exported from another country (whether or not occupied) is not
sufficient to make it tainted. Where an object has been removed or excavated contrary to the law
of the occupied territory, it will be tainted within the meaning of the 2003 Act. However, the
2003 Act does not itself impose a prohibition on the import of tainted cultural goods, so that
such goods will not be liable to forfeiture under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979,
and no provision is made in the Act which might enable tainted goods to be returned to the
competent authorities of the country from which they originate.
Both the police and Customs officers have powers of seizure for objects which are potential
evidence in relation to the investigation of an offence, under the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984. Even where these powers of seizure are triggered, for example, because an offence has
been committed in relation to an item illegally exported from an occupied territory, the United
Kingdom would not necessarily be able to comply with its obligations under the 1954 Protocol.
Even if an object can be seized, the police would not have the power to retain that object
indefinitely (as might be required if the occupation of the territory concerned has not ceased),
or to return it to the competent authorities of the territory concerned.
The United Kingdom’s difficulty in complying with these obligations is likely to be most acute
where no offence has been committed by the person in possession of an item which has been
illegally exported from an occupied territory. In such a case, neither the police nor HM Revenue
and Customs would have power to seize the item.
The provisions of the Bill, therefore, are designed to ensure that the government has an effective
power to seize any such cultural property, retain it until the end of hostilities (and take necessary
safeguarding measures in relation to it), and return it to the competent authorities.
The provision of immunity from seizure
The Convention requires Parties to give immunity from “seizure, placing in prize, or capture” to
any cultural property which is protected under the Convention and to the means of transport
exclusively engaged in transferring protected cultural property.
Existing UK law provides immunity from seizure in limited circumstances. Two categories of
property are recognised as being entitled to immunity – diplomatic property, and some state
property. In order to comply with our obligations under the Convention, however, it will be
necessary to provide immunity from seizure which is sufficiently extensive to cover any of the
circumstances outlined in the Convention.

Consultation
On 6 September 2005 DCMS launched a public consultation on the 1954 Hague Convention on
the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and its two Protocols of 1954
and 1999. The consultation closed on 2 December 2005 and a total of 54 organisations and
individuals responded to the consultation.

86

Six themes were highlighted for consultation:
G

General Protection – the types of cultural property that should receive general protection
under the Convention;

G

Coverage – whether the protection offered by the Convention should be mandatory or
voluntary;

G

Responsibility – who should be responsible for taking the peacetime safeguarding
measures illustrated in the Convention and its two Protocols;

G

Special Emblem – whether the affixing of a special emblem to protected property should
be mandatory or voluntary;

G

Special Protection – whether the UK should make use of the provisions for special
protection; and

G

Enhanced Protection – the types of cultural property that should be given enhanced
protection under the Second Protocol.

These issues were related to how the Convention would be implemented in practice in the UK
following ratification and did not cover the proposed provisions of the Bill (although, clearly
some of the issues raised, such as on the special emblem, were relevant to the Bill).
The Government published a response to the consultation on 4 November 2006. Copies of both
the consultation document and the Government’s response can be downloaded via the DCMS
website at:

Assessment Period
Many of the measures contained in the Bill only operate during periods of armed conflict. The
establishment of a rigorous assessment mechanism for these measures will, therefore, be difficult
as it will only be possible to determine whether the measures to protect cultural property in
periods of armed conflict are effective once there has been an armed conflict in which the UK is
involved. Additionally, the success of the other measures is dependent upon the UK being used
as a haven for both legitimate and illegitimate cultural property removed from an occupied
territory. However, the measures related to inappropriate use of the blue shield and to prohibit the
trade in cultural property illegally removed from occupied territory have a permanent effect and
these measures can be assessed on a regular basis. Therefore, a five year assessment period has
been introduced for the Bill.

Costs
None of the measures proposed incur any one off costs, either monetised or non-monetised.
There may be annual costs associated with the measures proposed, but these are likely to be
minimal. The groups who will be affected by these costs are:
G

the owners/guardians of protected cultural property;

G

dealers in cultural property;

G

the prosecuting authorities;

G

the enforcement authorities; and

G

central government.

87

Owners/guardians
Owners/guardians of cultural property protected by the Convention may choose to affix the blue
shield to their cultural property to visibly demonstrate that it is protected by the Convention. The
blue shield may be affixed during peace time or only in times of armed conflict. The affixing of
such an emblem is, however, an entirely voluntary matter. Neither the Bill nor the Convention
require it. Cultural property will not lose its protection through the Convention because no
emblem is affixed. Furthermore, the affixing of the emblem is not the only means by which
enemy commanders will be able to identify protected property. It is the Government’s intention
to provide a password protected list to UNESCO, containing the GPS co-ordinates of all cultural
property that the Government considers to be protected by the Convention. In the event of armed
conflict the password will be supplied to any aggressor State and so there can be no doubt about
the cultural property in the UK that is protected under the Convention. Thus, any costs incurred
by private owners in affixing the emblem will be borne on a voluntary basis.
Dealers in cultural property
The Bill will create a new offence of dealing in cultural property with the knowledge or
reasonable suspicion that it has been illegally exported from occupied territory. It will also
provide that cultural property that has been unlawfully exported from occupied territory is liable
to forfeiture whether or not an offence has been committed (even when a subsequent purchase
has been made in good faith – provision is made for the court to assess the compensation due in
these cases). This will have an impact on both those who buy and sell cultural property such as
dealers in antiquities and auction houses and those who purchase cultural property such as
museums and galleries and private collectors. They will need to satisfy themselves that objects
presented for sale have not been removed illegally from an occupied territory. This may require
them carrying out additional due diligence measures when they are dealing in material which
might be come under the scope of the proposed measures.
We do not, however, believe that these further checks will impose any significant new costs on
dealers in cultural property. The provisions only apply to cultural property removed from
occupied territory. The number of occupied territories around the world is currently very small
(the only territories which the UK would now regard as being unequivocally occupied are the
West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights) and so the number of objects affected is small
by comparison with the totality of cultural property that is traded by UK dealers.
In addition, dealers will not be required to do anything more than is required under, for example,
the Code of practice for the Control of International Trading in Works of Art (compliance with
which is a condition of membership of the British Antique Dealers Association and which is
subscribed to by other organisations representing art and antique dealers in this country). Under
that Code, Dealers undertake, not to import, export or transfer the ownership of such objects
where they have reasonable cause to believe, inter alia:
“(b) That an imported object has been acquired in or exported from its country of export in
violation of that country’s laws; and
(c) That an imported object was acquired dishonestly or illegally from an official excavation
site or monument or originated from an illegal, clandestine or otherwise unofficial site.”
The Code of Conduct of the Antiquities Dealers Association is also relevant and contains the
following provisions that members agree to follow:
1. I undertake to the best of my ability to make my purchases in good faith. To this end I
will establish the identity of the vendor and obtain a warranty that they have good title
to the objects and where applicable have confirmation from the vendor that the item has
been exported or imported in conformity with local laws. It is recommended that
wherever possible members should arrange payment by a method that leaves an audit
trail.

88

2. I undertake not to purchase or sell objects until I have established, to the best of my
ability, that such objects were not stolen from excavations, architectural monuments,
public institutions or private property.
The checks necessary to comply with these undertakings would reveal whether or not objects
have been unlawfully excavated from occupied territory. Accordingly, we do not think that the
Bill will in practice require dealers to incur greater costs than those to which they are already
subject.
Prosecuting/enforcement authorities
As explained above, the 1954 Hague Convention and its Two Protocols, broadly speaking,
imposes three categories of obligations on signatories:
(i) to take measures to protect one’s own cultural property when under attack;
(ii) to take measures to protect another State’s cultural property when one is attacking or
occupying that State; and
(iii) to take measures to stop the illegal removal and sale of cultural artefacts removed from
a territory under occupation.
We believe that the costs incurred under each of these categories is likely to be very low and our
reasons for this are as follows:
Measures to protect the UK’s cultural property when under attack
Europe has seen a period of protracted period of peace since the conclusion of the Second World
War and the creation of the European Union. The Government’s assessment of the short and
medium term threat of armed invasion of the UK by another country is zero. Thus, the likelihood
of there needing to be any prosecutions in respect of this element of the Convention is considered
to be practically zero.
Measures to protect other countries’ cultural property when UK forces are operating overseas
The 1954 Hague Convention is treated by the UK military as being part of customary
international law and so British troops have for a number of years been trained in the need to
respect cultural property and not to subject it to unnecessary attack or damage. The Tri-Service
Manual has instructions explicitly covering cultural property and this forms part of the training
for all UK troops. Thus, the likelihood of UK troops being prosecuted under this Bill for
damaging cultural property is extremely small. It is worth noting in this regard that although
there have been instances of damage to cultural property in Iraq by coalition forces, none of
these have been carried out by UK troops.
In relation to the most serious offences under Article 15(1) of the 1999 Protocol, we would be
obliged to take jurisdiction over offences committed anywhere if the offender is present in UK
territory. However, we are only aware of one prosecution being brought internationally in relation
to the destruction of cultural property (this relates to a Serb commander’s destruction of cultural
property during the war with Bosnia-Herzegovina), and there is no reason to suppose that our
adherence to the Convention and its Protocols would lead to demand for such prosecutions in the
UK.
Measures to stop the illegal removal and sale of cultural property from an occupied territory
The cost of a police investigation may be in the region of £3,000, though this figure increases with
the complexity of the investigation (figure provided by the Art and Antiques Unit, Metropolitan
Police). Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs are not able to provide a similar figure for the
investigations they would have to undertake as there are too many variables involved to make any
calculation reliable. Figures provided by the Crown Prosecution Service suggest that a trial where
the accused pleads not guilty would cost in the region of £3,000, whereas, a guilty plea would
reduce that figure to £500.

89

However, it is worth noting that the Dealing in Cultural Objects (Offences) Act 2003 and the
Iraq (United Nations Sanctions) Order 2003 both contain similar (but not identical) offences to
those proposed in the Bill in relation to the illegal removal and sale of cultural property from
occupied territory. There have been no prosecutions to date under either the Act or the Order. In
addition, the number of countries which currently meet the agreed definition of occupied territory
is very small (we are currently only aware of 3 such territories – the West Bank, the Gaza Strip
and the Golan Heights. Other territories may have been occupied in the past, but we do not believe
that the number of such territories is significant). Thus, while there is a possibility that there
might be prosecutions under this part of the proposed Bill we believe that the chances of this
happening are extremely small (and therefore it is unlikely that the costs outlined above will be
incurred). It is worth noting that the First Protocol has been ratified by 93 countries and has been
in existence for over 50 years. During that period we are only aware of one occasion in which the
authorities of an occupied territory have sought to use the Protocol to obtain the return of cultural
property unlawfully exported from their territory.
Any costs relating to the return of cultural property to its country of origin would be incurred by
central government and are covered below in that section.
Central Government
Central Government will not incur any additional costs directly associated with the Bill other than
the possible need to store cultural property that has been removed from an occupied territory
until such time as it can be returned to a competent authority. For the reasons explained above,
however, we anticipate that the number of such cases arising will be minimal.
The Government may also incur costs if it is obliged to pay compensation to the holders in good
faith of cultural property which has been unlawfully exported from occupied territory and must
be returned to the authorities of that territory. However, this only applies where the UK is the
occupying power in relation to that territory, and therefore would be in a position and under an
obligation to prevent the export of cultural property. The UK is not currently an occupying power.
The Government and its non-departmental public bodies will incur some additional costs
associated with implementation of the 1954 Hague Convention and its Two Protocols in the UK.
For example, the costs associated with producing and then periodically updating the list of
cultural property that the Government considers to be protected by the Convention. It is
anticipated, however, that these costs can be absorbed within current budgets and therefore not
require any additional funds.

Benefits
The main benefits of the proposals centre around the protection of cultural property in the UK
and internationally and the formalising of our armed forces’ responsibilities to cultural property
when operating abroad. The main beneficiaries of this are the military, owners/guardians of
protected cultural property, occupied States and the general public (both within the UK and
internationally). The benefits of the proposal are difficult to monetise given the large and varied
number of cultural assets covered by the Bill. Furthermore, many of the benefits can only be
realised in the event of an armed conflict and/or occupation.
General public (both within the UK and internationally)
The purpose of the Bill (and the Convention and its two Protocols) is the protection of cultural
property during times of armed conflict. The deliberate destruction of cultural property during
armed conflict is often carried out with the express intention of either demoralising a defending
nation by attacking the fabric of that which it holds dear or by eradicating all trace of a particular
ethnic or religious group that the attackers wish to exterminate. The protection and preservation
of cultural property during armed conflict is, thus, of major benefit to all people. The
psychological, morale, economic and cultural identity benefits of protecting the nation’s most
important cultural assets (which are often used to identify a nation or race of people) in times of
armed conflict would be difficult to monetise.

90

Military
The UK military is already trained to respect cultural property when carrying out operations
abroad and, wherever necessary, take reasonable steps to ensure that cultural property does not
become the object of attack. The provisions of the Bill will formalise the responsibilities of
military commanders in this respect and will provide both greater certainty over what is and is
not permitted and provide a legal framework within which to take and validate decisions. This
will provide clarity to military commanders and personnel with regard to what they can and can’t
do and where the responsibility for actions lie.
Owners/guardians
The introduction of the protection regimes which include the use of the emblem, along with other
measures to be undertaken by central government, will put in place mechanisms which, it is
hoped, will prevent UK cultural property from becoming the object of attack in the event of
invasion. This will have clear financial and psychological benefits to those who own or act as
guardians to such property.
Occupied States
The measures proposed within the Bill include introducing an offence of dealing in cultural
property unlawfully removed from an occupied territory, provision for the forfeiture and return
of such property to its country of origin and immunity from seizure for cultural property which
is brought into the UK for safe keeping from an occupied State. These measures will assist
occupied states by protecting and where necessary recovering their cultural heritage.

Key Assumptions/Sensitivities/Risks
The Bill cost and benefit models outlined above are based on three assumptions:
G

that UK armed forces already act in a way which would not contravene any of the
offences being proposed. This assumption is based on the recent operations of the UK
armed forces and the inclusion of a section in the Tri-Service Manual which outlines
their general responsibilities regarding cultural property;

G

that there will be a low level of offences committed under the provisions included within
the Bill. This refers not only to offences committed by UK armed forces personnel (for
reasons outlined above), but also those offences that relate to dealing in cultural property
illegally removed from an occupied State and those concerning the illegal use of the
emblem. These assumptions are based on the low number of countries which are currently
considered occupied, and the low level of offences regarding the illegal use of other
international humanitarian emblems (e.g. the Red Cross); and

G

that it will be unlikely that the UK will be in a position of having to pay compensation
to a good faith purchaser of an item of cultural property if that property needs to be
returned to its country of origin (having been illegally removed). This is because the
system being put in place means that the only scenario where such compensation would
be payable would be where the UK is the occupying power, which we consider unlikely
in the current climate.

Enforcement
The Bill contains a number of offences and so the issue of enforcement is a key one. As has been
explained above, it is not envisaged that these additional offences will add significantly to the
workload of any of the enforcement agencies. The enforcement agencies concerned will be the
Police and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.
Appropriate use of the blue shield will on application be authorised by a representative of the
Secretary of State. In the case of immovable cultural property this will be English Heritage and
in the case of movable cultural property this will be the Museums, Libraries and Archives
Council. The equivalent of these organisations will exercise the same function in each of the

91

Devolved Administrations. As explained above, we will not be encouraging the affixing of the
blue shield and, therefore, anticipate the number of cases in which such authorisation will be
required will be small.
The enforcement regime will meet the Hampton Review principles.

Offsetting
There are no offsetting measures planned. The proposals laid out in the Bill will not place an
excessive additional regulatory burden on stakeholders and there are no areas in which existing
regulations can readily be simplified.

Greenhouse gas emissions
The only impact that this policy may have on greenhouse emissions relates to the potential need
to transport cultural property in times of armed conflict. There is a low likelihood of such a crisis
occurring and were it to occur, the impact on gas emissions would be low, as only one journey
would be needed to move the cultural property in question from the location in danger to a place
of safety.

Competition Assessment
Using the Office of Fair Trading’s Competitive Impact filter, of the nine questions, all were
answered ‘No’. As a result, it was concluded that it was highly unlikely that the proposed
measures would have an impact on competition.
