Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Foreword from Chris Smith, Secretary of State

The fundamental aim of DCMS is to offer everyone in this country
the opportunity to improve the quality of their life through cultural
and sporting activity. The wonderful performance of British
athletes in Sydney last September made us all proud, and DCMS
strives to develop such high levels of excellence in all fields of
culture, media and sport. We also recognise, however, that
excellence can emerge only out of opportunity, and that the talent
displayed by British Olympians flourished in large part thanks to
the assistance provided by National Lottery funding. That is why
we as a Department set such store on policies which make the
creative life of the nation available to the greatest possible number
of people.
In the past year, the commitment that we have shown since 1997 to
this agenda has been rewarded by a successful Spending Review
settlement, that acknowledged the value that cultural and sporting
activity can add to people’s lives, and resulted in a very substantial
increase in Departmental programme funding, from £1,015 million
in 2000–01 to £1,240 million in 2003–04. In May 2000, DCMS
was the first Government Department to undergo a review as part
of the Modernising Government agenda. I was delighted to see
that the review panel, composed of representatives from public and
private sectors, identified us as a Department that is punching
above its weight in Whitehall, with a desire for constant
improvement and a willingness to innovate.
In 2000–01, the Department has worked hard to sustain its
growing reputation, and we have been responsible for a number of
important initiatives. The joint DCMS/DTI White Paper A New
Future for Communications set out the Government’s proposals for
the reform of broadcasting and telecommunications regulation in
the digital era. We brought in free television licences for everyone
of 75 or over, from November. We announced the development of
Culture Online, a new forum for the interactive provision of
cultural resources over the internet. We are developing 16 Creative
Partnerships in the most deprived areas of the country, combining
the expertise of schools, arts organisations and other cultural
bodies to provide children in these areas with opportunities to take
part in or experience the Arts. Sports funding will double over the
period 2001–04, increasing substantially the investment we are
already making in the school sports co-ordinator programme,
developing physical education and competitive sport for young
people. Moreover, as part of the New Opportunities Fund initiative,

999059 DCMS Section 1-2001

£750 million of Lottery money will be provided for the
construction and refurbishment of school sports facilities in areas
where sporting provision generally is weak, for the benefit of the
whole community.
In April 1999 we had been able to introduce free entry to all the
national museums and galleries for children; in April 2000 we were
able to extend this to everyone of 60 or over. This has resulted in
an increase of nearly 10 per cent in the numbers of children
attending, and a 40 per cent increase in the numbers of over-60s,
a clear case of the changes we have made bringing greater access
to excellence for more people. Our decision to provide additional
funds so that Tate Modern could open free to all, last May, has
seen 31/2 million visitors coming to see a modern art gallery that
has rapidly established itself as one of the world’s finest.
We are now making additional resources available from
1 December 2001, to allow the sponsored national museums and
galleries which currently charge to introduce free admission from
that date. This follows the announcement by the Chancellor in
March 2001 of Budget changes which will enable all statesponsored museums and galleries that are free to recover their
input VAT related to free admission. This will enable me to honour
a long-standing personal commitment to restore the principle of
free entry that we so tragically lost in the 1980s. It will allow the
greatest collections that we have, built up by public funds over the
generations, to be available to everyone, no matter what their
income or background may be. The recent Budget also included a
number of welcome measures that will benefit other Departmental
sectors; an extension to tax breaks for the British film industry;
plans for a new tax relief to benefit community amateur sports
clubs; and funding for a grant scheme for the repair of listed places
of worship.
The Department also has an important role to play in promoting
the success of the creative industries and tourism. This year I was
able to convene the first Tourism Summit, bringing together all the
relevant Ministers, demonstrating our commitment to the
development of the tourism industry and establishing, for the first
time, a network of the officials who work in tourism throughout
government. The Film Council came fully into being in April 2000
and in May published the first stage of its strategy for the creation
of a sustainable film industry in Britain. We are also working to

999059 DCMS Section 1-2001

4/3/01

19:09

Page 6

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

bring the creative industries into the agenda of mainstream
government, with considerable success. The Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, for example, has now established a Britain
Abroad Task Force, which will promote the UK’s creative economy
across the globe.
The Department has continued to work closely in partnership with
other Government Departments. In particular we have continued
to pursue our educational objectives alongside DfEE: launching the
£150 million Space for Sport and Arts scheme, which will bring
new facilities to primary schools for the benefit of the whole
community; finalising the new Curriculum Framework, which
places greater emphasis on creative, cultural and physical
education; and developing a National Adult Basic Skills Strategy.
In the new spending period, education, both inside and outside
schools, features more prominently than ever in our programme.
The National Lottery also continues to be an important part of
what we do, and the Department, through the New Opportunities
Fund and the Awards for All scheme, is working to ensure that
Lottery money flows to help community organisations and
initiatives, and not only to fund large capital projects. An action
group has been set up to improve the geographical distribution of
Lottery funding, helping to restore the balance for areas, such as
the former coalfields, which have received relatively few Lottery
awards up to now. The Department chaired the Social Exclusion
Unit’s Policy Action Team 10, and in the aftermath of their report,
which identified the significant part that arts and sport can play in
neighbourhood renewal, DCMS has produced a progress report,
Building on PAT 10, which presents action plans for the
contributions that arts, sport, museums, libraries and the built
environment can make to social inclusion. We are encouraging
local authorities to include objectives for social inclusion in their
own local cultural strategies.
We have drawn up new three-year funding agreements with each of
our sponsored bodies. One of the first tasks of the Department’s
Quality, Efficiency and Standards Team, when it was formed in
1999, was to review the funding agreement process, and the report
which they produced, in September 2000, provided the basis for a
new round of agreements which make the relationship between the
work of our sponsored bodies and our own strategic objectives
much clearer and better defined.

2000 was a year of celebration and DCMS has co-ordinated the
Government’s role in the Millennium celebrations across the UK,
which culminated on 31 December in last night celebrations across
32 UK towns and cities. Millennium Commission projects have
ranged from the very large, in the case of Tate Modern, the British
Museum, the Lowry Centre or the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff,
to very small local developments, such as the construction of new
village halls or the creation of village greens. The Millennium
Dome may not have been the success that was hoped for in terms
of visitor targets, but it has provided a valuable stimulus to the
regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula and of the Thames
Gateway.
Our aim this year has been very simple: to bring opportunity to the
greatest number to experience the things in life which can bring
them great personal pleasure and satisfaction, things that can
sometimes change their lives for ever. I believe we have achieved a
lot, in pursuing that goal.

Delivering Better Public Services

DCMS has developed clear objectives with stretching but realistic targets that will
be used to measure its success in attaining its own aims and in developing the
Government’s wider social, educational and economic priorities. The Department is
also working to raise standards and improve the services it delivers in line with the
Modernising Government initiative.
1.1 Introduction
In setting out its spending plans for 1999–2002 in the 1998
Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), the Government set new
priorities for public spending with significant extra resources in
key services such as education and health. Expenditure by DCMS
was also set to increase, by £121 million over the three-year
period, giving a clear indication of the importance of the
Department’s activity in addressing the Government’s wider social,
educational and economic objectives. The Government also made a
commitment to link this extra investment to modernisation and
reform in order to raise standards and improve the quality of public
services. The White Paper Public Services for the Future:
Modernisation, Reform, Accountability (Cm 4315) delivered this
commitment by publishing for the first time measurable targets,
within Departmental Public Service Agreements (PSAs), for the
full range of the Government’s objectives. A full and detailed report
on all these targets was published in the March 2000
Departmental Reports.
The Government recognised at the time of the 1998 CSR that
setting targets for central Government was a process that would
need to be refined over time. In the 2000 Spending Review, which
set new plans for public spending for 2001 to 2004, the
Government has further developed its PSAs in order to identify the
most important goals and reforms that it wants to deliver. These
targets were set out in July 2000 in the White Paper, Spending
Review 2000: Public Service Agreements 2001–04, (Cm 4808), and will
be fully reported on in the Spring 2002 departmental reports. The
Department’s response to the Spending Review 2000, and its new
PSA, are set out in Chapter 3 below.
The White Paper, Modernising Government, published in March

999059 DCMS Section 1-2001

4/3/01

19:22

Page 11

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

11

1999, is a statement of the Government’s vision for reform and
modernisation of the delivery of public services. These principles
provide a means of achieving PSA targets. The Department has
published a Modernising Government Action Plan, which was
reported on in the 2000 Departmental Report. The latest progress
against this plan is set out here, below the PSA progress report.
1.2 Progress report on DCMS Public Service Agreement
Summary of aims and objectives
In the Comprehensive Spending Review, completed in July 1998,
the Department agreed new aims and objectives.
Aim
To improve the quality of life for all through cultural and sporting
activities and to strengthen the creative industries.
The Department will:
work to bring quality and excellence in the fields of culture,
media and sport;
make those available to the many, not just to the few;
raise standards of cultural education and training;
help to develop the jobs of the future in the creative industries.
Objectives
The Department, working in partnership with others, works to:
create an efficient and competitive market by removing obstacles
to growth and unnecessary regulation so as to promote Britain’s
success in the fields of culture, media, sport and tourism at home
and abroad;
broaden access for this and future generations to a rich and
varied cultural and sporting life and to our distinctive built
environment;
raise the standards of cultural education and training

ensure that everyone has the opportunity to achieve excellence in
the areas of culture, media and sport and to develop talent,
innovation and good design;
maintain public support for the National Lottery and ensure that
the objective of the Lottery Fund supports DCMS’ and other
national priorities; and
promote the role of the Department’s sectors in urban and rural
regeneration, in pursuing sustainability and in combatting social
exclusion.
In carrying out these objectives, the Department will seek maximum
value for money in using its human and financial resources,
through applying the principles of efficiency and effectiveness in its
sectors and in encouraging partnership with others.
1.3 Performance targets
Following the identification of these objectives in the
Comprehensive Spending Review, the Department undertook to
devise measurable targets against them, and in the PSA published
in December 1998 21 such targets were agreed. To complete the
picture of how the Department would measure the success of its
objectives, an Output and Performance Analysis (OPA) was agreed
in March 1999 which included additional performance indicators
used to measure and monitor success against Departmental and
PSA targets.
Target by target progress is given below. To summarise, 15 targets
have already been met, three are on course, and three have been
partly met, with other parts ongoing or on course.

To increase national productivity (objective 1)
PSA Target 1
Facilitate and promote our competitiveness, both at home and
abroad, in the creative industries.
Progress
Through the programme of reviews commissioned by the Creative
Industries Task Force, and co-ordinated by the Creative Industries
Unit, the Department was able to draw up a series of
recommendations for removing barriers to growth in the creative
industries, in areas such as skills and training, finance, intellectual
property rights, export promotion, contributing to the regional
economic development, and the Internet. Through the
implementation of these recommendations we have, for example in
the field of export promotion, made the provision of support to
creative businesses more focused and fitter for purpose.
In addition to better dissemination of statistics on the creative
industries, work is under way to make the creative industries fully
visible within the classifications used in official statistics. The
Census of Population in 2001 will provide benchmark data, at least
until further refinements to the classification are possible later in
the decade. The coverage of statistics on the creative industries is
being expanded to meet policy and other requirements for more
detailed statistics, mainly in audiovisual and related sectors.

PSA Target 2
Promotion of quality tourism development which is economically,
environmentally and socially sustainable and supports the
Government’s employment objectives. These plans were detailed in
the new Tourism Strategy published early in 1999.
Progress
The performance measure agreed for this target was the level of
expenditure in the UK by domestic and overseas tourists and a
target of £27.1 billion was set for 1999, against which an outturn
of £28.9 billion was achieved. For 2000, a new target of £29.1
billion has been set, and early indications are that the latest
outturn for the calendar year is some £29.5 billion and that the
target has therefore been achieved.
Following last year’s successful launch of new grading schemes for
hotels, guest accommodation and caravan parks, the English
Tourism Council (ETC) has now extended the range of schemes to
include self-catering accommodation. In July the ETC launched a
new scheme ‘Stepping Stones’, to help raise standards in areas of
lower quality accommodation.
PSA Target 3
Develop proposals for a future regulatory system for broadcasting
which recognises market and technological developments.
Progress
The joint DCMS/DTI White Paper A New Future for
Communications was published on 12 December 2000. It proposes
new measures to reform current legislation on broadcasting and
telecommunications in the light of technological convergence and
market changes.

999059 DCMS Section 1-2001

PSA Target 4
Facilitate and generally promote the competitiveness of UK
broadcast-related industries and in particular the early take-up of
digital broadcast services.
Progress
The Government’s response to the Creative Industries Task Force
Television Export Inquiry (November 1999) was published in July
and good progress has since been made both by Government and
Industry in taking issues forward. The Action Plan is being
regularly monitored and updated.
Consultants were appointed to undertake an in-depth look at the
programme supply market in the digital age, with an emphasis on
realising the potential of UK creative talent and fostering
competition within the industry. Their report, Out of the Box,
which informed the Communications White Paper, was published
on the Departmental website in December, and can be found at
www.culture.gov.uk/creative
The Department worked with the broadcasting industry and
consumer groups to produce a set of key messages for consumers
about the benefits of digital television, which the Secretary of State
launched at the Royal Television Society Autumn Symposium on
31 October 2000. We aim to continue to work with industry where
possible on their own promotions (for example, on their leaflet
campaigns). Current take-up is 26 per cent, compared with
11 per cent this time last year.
UK switchover strategy has been promoted in the Lisbon
conference and in Europe generally.

PSA Target 5
Ensure public service broadcasters sustain quality and range of
output. In particular, review the BBC licence fee and publish review
conclusions for consultation by July 1999.
Progress
The BBC will receive an estimated £200 million extra per year to
help fund new channels and programmes. Responding to the report
of the independent panel on the future funding of the BBC chaired
by Gavyn Davies, Chris Smith welcomed the BBC’s main priorities:
to improve established services, especially BBC1; to expand
education work; to develop interactive services; and to enhance
regional services as the BBC moves into the digital age.
The Department had an active involvement in State Aid policy
discussions with the European Commission and Member States,
promoting UK interests with regard to the uptake of new services
by public service broadcasters.
PSA Target 6
Work with the British film industry to implement a new jointfunded strategy for the development of the industry by April 2000,
as envisaged by the Film Policy Review.
Progress
In May 2000, the Film Council published Towards a Sustainable UK
Film Industry. This proposed a series of major new initiatives as a
first stage towards creating a sustainable and entrepreneurial
British film industry. A second stage, aimed at generating long
term structural change in the industry, will be published in 2001.
A study of user needs for statistics, together with a directory of
existing sources, has been produced. This work was largely funded
by an EC programme to improve audiovisual statistics.

To widen access (objectives 2 and 3)
PSA Target 7
Visitor numbers in major national museums to increase
substantially, in line with the removal of entry charges for children
in 1999–2000, for pensioners in 2000–01 and for others in 2001, if
Trustees decide to remove entry charges while maintaining the
quality of exhibitions.
Progress
Following the introduction of free admission for under-16s at all
museums and galleries sponsored directly by DCMS from 1 April
1999, the number of under-16 visitors has increased by 9.9 per cent.
Since free admission was introduced for visitors aged 60 and over
at a significant number of museums and galleries on 1 April 2000,
the number of over-60s visitors has increased by 41 per cent.
Overall visitor figures for 1999–2000 at DCMS sponsored museums
and galleries were 23.5 million. Projected figures for the year
2000–01 show an increase in this overall figure of 14 per cent.
PSA Target 8
Access to the performing arts will increase by attracting new
audiences over the next two years. New companies, new work and
new venues will be funded and the New Audiences Fund will
continue to widen access to the arts.
Progress
Attendance figures at organisations funded by the Arts Council for
1999–2000 showed a marked increase (nearly 2 million) over those
recorded for 1998–99, and the Arts Council are currently
forecasting an additional 100,000 attendances by the end of the
CSR period (2001–02) – considerably more than the targets that
were originally set. The New Audiences Fund is a key element in
achieving wider access to the arts, and already one and a half
million people have participated in New Audiences projects.

PSA Target 9
Raise standards of care of collections and public access by
establishing a £15 million Challenge Fund by 1999 to fund new
investment in the 43 Designated Museums.
Progress
The Designated Museums Challenge Fund was established in
1999. Two bidding rounds have been completed and £6.9 million
has been awarded. A third bidding round is under way. There are
now 62 museums or groups of museums in England with
designated status, all of which are eligible for funding, and
decisions on allocations will be made in Spring 2001.
PSA Target 10
Extend social inclusiveness by increasing the involvement of
identified priority groups in each of the sectors the Department
has responsibility for.
Progress
Guidance has been prepared on monitoring social inclusion in the
cultural sector and on key performance indicators for bodies
funding social inclusion projects and programmes. Results from
the UK Time Use Survey and from funding agreements will be
available from 2001 to help identify priority groups.
DCMS public bodies now have in place their social inclusion
strategies and action plans. A strategy for architecture and the
built heritage will be developed during 2001. There are six culture
and leisure commitments in the January 2001 National
Neighbourhood Renewal Action Plan. In May 2000, DCMS issued
Centres for Social Change, a policy document aimed at helping
museums, galleries and archives in England to combat social
exclusion. Following consultation on this document, an action plan
for libraries, museums, galleries and archives will be published.

PSA Target 11
Maintain standards and diversity of broadcasting output and
ensure that content is socially inclusive, to secure wide access to
broadcast material.
Progress
The Cultural Diversity Network (established by television
broadcasters in February 1999) published its action plans in
October 2000. These are aimed at enhancing the representation of
our multi-cultural society on the television screen and, behind the
scenes, in employment within the industry.
In January 2001 Ministers announced a review of the statutory
targets for subtitling, signing and audio description on digital
terrestrial television. The opportunity was taken, as part of the
review, to consider other aspects of the provision and reception of
these services, including cable and satellite television.
A consultation paper was published in July following preliminary
discussions with interested parties. The results of the review were
published on the departmental website in January 2001 and hard
copies were sent to people who responded to the consultation
paper. As a result, we concluded that the target for the provision of
subtitling on Digital Terrestrial Television services should be
raised from 50 per cent of programmes by the tenth anniversary of
the start of the service to 80 per cent by the tenth anniversary, and
that targets should be extended to cable and satellite services when
the legislative opportunity permits.

To harness the educational potential of DCMS funded institutions
(objectives 2 and 3)
PSA Target 12
200,000 new educational sessions undertaken by arts organisations.
Progress
The target of 200,000 additional sessions per year was to be
achieved over the course of the CSR period. From a baseline of
1,865,000, the number of sessions rose by 94,000 to 1,959,000 in
the year 1999–2000. Current forecasts indicate a further rise to
2,083,000 in 2000–01 and to 2,150,000 by the end of the CSR
period, i.e. exceeding the target.
PSA Target 13
Make the most of the potential of libraries by doubling the number
of Internet connections by 2000 and ensuring that at least 75 per
cent of public libraries have Internet connections by 2002.
Progress
This target has been more than achieved. From a baseline of 5 per
cent in 1997, the percentage of static public libraries with Internet
connections had already reached 41 per cent by December 2000.
This encouraging rate of progress has allowed the target to be
revised upwards to 80 per cent by December 2001 and 100 per cent
by December 2002.

To agree new standards of effectiveness with DCMS funded bodies
(all objectives)
PSA Target 14
Funding agreements of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs)
to be conditional on quantified improvements in outputs, efficiency,
access, quality promotion, income generation or private sector
funding, monitored by a new independent watchdog. Targets to be
announced in funding agreements March 1999.
Progress
Funding agreements have been agreed with all NDPBs and are
reviewed twice yearly. New agreements were negotiated in 2000
for the Council for Museums, Libraries and Archives (Resource),
the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment
(CABE) and the Film Council. QUEST was established in July
1999 and in September 2000 published A New Approach to Funding
Agreements, which advocated a more strategic measurement of the
impact, rather than simply the level of activity carried out by
sponsored bodies. Following the Spending Review 2000, NDPBs
have now renegotiated funding agreements for the period 2001–04,
based on QUEST’s new approach.
PSA Target 15
Improve efficiency by completing the review of national museums
and galleries by end July 1999.
Progress
The review was completed on time. As a consequence of the review,
standard performance targets have been incorporated in
the funding agreements of the DCMS sponsored museums and
galleries.

To streamline policy delivery mechanisms (all objectives)
PSA Target 16
Subject to the outcome of a consultation exercise, establish new
funding councils for the Performing and Visual Arts and for Film,
and create a new national strategic body for museums, libraries and
archives in place of existing structures and exchange existing
frameworks of support for heritage, sport and tourism to achieve a
long term saving of£23 million.
Progress
The Film Council, Commission for Architecture and the Built
Environment (CABE) and the Museums, Archives and Libraries
Council (Resource) have all been established. Administrative
changes have been introduced for sport, the English Tourist Board
has been reconstituted as the smaller, and more strategic, English
Tourism Council, and a major restructuring involving the effective
merger of English Heritage and the Royal Commission on the
Historical Monuments of England has taken place. The Arts
Council has assumed responsibility for the crafts sector and for
funding the Crafts Council.
The PSA figure of£23 million for long-term savings was
speculative and ambitious. However, a significant annual saving of
over £7 million has already been made through the restructuring
of the arts, tourism and heritage sectors, and this money has been
redirected into front-line services. The Department is working
with its NDPBs to find further efficiencies that will deliver
increased long-term savings.
PSA Target 17
Establish the new Film Council by April 2000 with clear objectives
to help develop film culture and a sustainable domestic film industry.
Progress
The Film Council was incorporated on 22 July 1999 and started to
operate on 1 April 2000, launching its strategy in May.

PSA Target 18
In streamlining support for the built heritage sector transfer the
Department’s responsibilities for operating the Heritage Grant
Fund (HGF) to English Heritage by 1 April 2000 and for
underwater archeology to the same body by the same date subject
to legislation.
Progress
The Heritage Grant Fund has now been transferred to English
Heritage. The transfer of underwater archaeology is dependent on
the Culture and Recreation Bill, which is currently before
Parliament.
PSA Target 19
Establish a new National Lottery Commission and transfer
functions from the Director General of the Office for National
Lottery to the Commission (effective from 1 April 1999).
Progress
The National Lottery Commission was established on 1 April 1999.
PSA Target 20
As required by the 1998 Act distributing bodies to develop by
1 April 1999 new strategic plans for Lottery funding designed to
achieve a proper balance between capital and revenue schemes and
between different regions of the country.
Progress
Strategic plans have been developed for all distributors with the
exception of the Millennium Commission, which is not required to
produce a plan.

PSA Target 21
Devolution of decision making to the regions, where possible, and
strengthened regional bodies.
Progress
Regional Cultural Consortiums are operating in all the regions and
are producing regional cultural strategies which should be ready
for publication by Easter 2001.
The success of the regionally based joint Lottery distributor
Awards for All scheme has led to its extension until March 2002 at
least. The Arts Council of England (ACE) has delegated decisions
about Lottery applications under £100,000 to the regional arts
boards, and Sport England is currently looking into the feasibility
of giving regional sports boards similar powers. The Heritage
Lottery Fund has fully operational Committees for Northern
Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the English regions to determine
applications of up to £1 million, and from April 2001, the powers
of the English Committee will devolve to nine separate regional
decision-making committees. The New Opportunities Fund (NOF)
has also recently announced its intention to establish a network of
regionally-based staff to improve communications and enhance the
delivery of its wide range of programmes.
1.4 Increasing the Productivity of Operations
The Department is committed to the efficient use of resources and
since its formation has contracted out most of the central and
support services to the private sector. Further reforms have been
carried out to streamline the organisation and working methods of
DCMS and its sponsored bodies, and these are detailed in Chapters
4 and 5 below. In addition, however, the Department has agreed
certain service delivery targets as part of its three year running
cost deal, performance against which is set out here.
Target
All invoices not in dispute to be paid within 30 days.
Progress
Outturn achieved as at 31 December 2000 was 99.0 per cent.

999059 DCMS Section 1-2001

Target
Answer 90 per cent of all external correspondence including
complaints within 18 working days.
Progress
The position at the end of December 2000 was 85 per cent.
Target
To reduce running costs as a proportion of the Departmental
Expenditure Limit (DEL).
Progress
The target set was for running costs for DCMS to reduce as a
proportion of DEL by 4.5 per cent over the period 1999–00 to
2001–02. DCMS currently estimates that by the end of 2001–02
running costs as a proportion of DEL will have decreased by
4 per cent.
Target
To achieve Investors in People accreditation by December 1999.
Progress
DCMS successfully achieved the IiP standard on 27 October 1999.

Target
To develop and introduce the library element of the new New
Opportunities Fund (NOF) Lottery funding stream for lifelong
learning.
Progress
This New Opportunities Fund programme has three elements:
£20 million to train public library staff in the use of ICT, £50
million to create digital content to be delivered via the network of
online libraries, and £100 million from the £200 million
Community Access to Lifelong Learning stream to develop the
library network infrastructure. The first funds for training began
to flow to libraries from September 2000. These were followed by
infrastructure funds from November 2000. Both these funding
streams flow to every UK library authority based on an assessment
of each authority’s needs carried out during the year. Funding for
digitisation is awarded on a challenge basis: the first stage selection
of projects was made during the year and the final selection will be
made during spring 2001.
Target
To ensure that the UK’s Millennium celebrations are a success,
that they leave a real legacy for the future and that the
Government’s contribution to the celebrations is delivered
effectively.
Progress
DCMS has co-ordinated the Government’s role in the Millennium
celebrations, working closely with the New Millennium Experience
Company (NMEC), the Millennium Commission, the devolved
administrations, other Government Departments, local authorities,
the Churches and other faith groups, and a wide range of public
and private sector organisations.
The Millennium Commission’s £2 billion Lottery-funded
programme to mark the millennium has supported a highly
successful year-long national festival, involving communities the
length and breadth of the country. It has also funded last night

celebrations in 32 towns and cities across the UK to mark the
culmination of a very special year, and projects ranging from new
village halls and community woodlands to landmarks like Tate
Modern, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and the Eden Project
in Cornwall, all of which will leave a real and lasting legacy for
future generations to enjoy.
The Millennium Dome has not been the success that all parties had
hoped for and it is a matter of regret that the original visitor target
was not met. This led to a 65 per cent drop in visitor revenue and
the subsequent need for additional Lottery funding.
It is important to highlight, however, that the Dome has been a
catalyst for the regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula and
provided a kick-start to the economy of one of the most deprived
local authority areas in England. Visitor satisfaction rates were
among the industry’s highest during its year of opening; the
attraction was voted Britain’s best new attraction in October 2000
and received a prestigious Major Project Award at the British
Construction Industry Awards 2000. In excess of £300 million of
business was awarded to contractors and suppliers all over the
country as a direct result of the Millennium Experience.
The National Programme of events and activities associated with
the Dome has been a great success. Education programmes have
promoted learning in song-writing, computer literacy, the
performing arts and science and technology. Resource packs using
the Dome as a basis for learning in construction, art and design,
and mathematics were issued to all 32,000 schools in the UK.
Every local education authority and library board in the UK
participated in a project to perform the story of their community
for a day in the Dome in 2000 and there were several ‘national
days’ including Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man
and Jersey. In total, there were 220 performances on the Our Town
Stage in the Dome, involving some 23,500 participants.
Both Houses of Parliament have an avid interest in the millennium
celebrations and the Commons’ Culture Media and Sport
Committee completed their fifth inquiry into them last year:

Marking the Millennium in the United Kingdom (October 2000).
A separate National Audit Office (NAO) report by the Comptroller
and Auditor General entitled The Millennium Dome was published
on 9 November 2000. DCMS has provided MPs and Peers with
regular updates on the progress of initiatives taken forward by the
Government, the Millennium Commission and NMEC to celebrate
the beginning of the third millennium as well as answering a
regular stream of questions in Parliament.
The £100 million Millennium Festival Fund funded by the
Lottery Distributors has supported projects on the millennial
theme of Making A Difference. Over 15,000 events, large and
small, have been supported across the UK as result of the Festival
which started on 31 December 1999 and continued until
31 December 2000. Festival events reached an estimated 40 million
people during the Year 2000 and included Youth FM (an internet
radio station run by and for young people), the Millennium Festival
of Cycling (a celebration of cycling using the new National Cycle
Network paths) and the Millennium Youth Games (38 regional
sporting competitions for young people which culminated in an
Olympic style final in Southampton in mid-August). Since it
started in 1996, the Millennium Commission’s Millennium Awards
Scheme has also proved highly successful in distributing grants of
between £2,000 and £15,000, helping over 14,000 individuals to
achieve personal goals and benefit their communities.
The Millennium Voyager toured the UK from 27 March until
September 2000 and visited 28 cities, country shows and projects
around the UK. Over 70,000 people visited the Voyager, a 40ft
touring exhibition unit, and were able to obtain information about
initiatives funded by the Millennium Commission and to see how
Lottery money has been invested in their area.

Target
To use DCMS estate effectively.
Progress
During the last year the Department has moved closer to a ‘single
roof ’ solution with the acquisition of the lease and subsequent
linking of Oceanic House to 2–4 Cockspur Street. DCMS has also
taken the head lease of Cockspur Street as the first step in a
strategy which, in the longer term, should allow it to move out of
Grove House. In the interim, the Departmental Solicitors have
been gathered together by their transfer from the Treasury
Solicitors’ offices to the Fourth Floor of Grove House. The
Government Art Collection has now been re-housed in more
suitable premises off Tottenham Court Road and 6 Burlington
Gardens, previously the Museum of Mankind, has been sold to the
Royal Academy. If the market allows, it is intended to dispose of
7 St James’s Square by surrendering or assigning its lease after
the departure of CABE.
Better Quality Services (BQS)
Target
DCMS will regularly and systematically review services and
activities over a five year period in line with Government policy as
set out in the handbook Better Quality Services. It will develop a
review programme by September 1999 setting out those services
that will be reviewed each year, with the intention to review at
least 60 per cent of services by March 2003.
Progress
A Better Quality Services review programme was drawn up in
October 1999. It is being implemented in the Department’s
NDPBs via quinquennial reviews. The Department is contributing
to the Cabinet Office’s work towards the relaunch of BQS
scheduled for summer 2001 and is taking the opportunity that this
presents to reshape its own programme consistent with
departmental needs.

Electronic Government
Target
The Department is fully committed to the Government’s
Electronic Service Delivery targets, the first target being 25 per
cent of services to be capable of electronic delivery by 2002.
Progress
100 per cent of the Department’s services are now capable of
electronic delivery.
Sickness Absence
Target
Reduce the average Departmental sickness absence. DCMS is
committed to reducing absence to seven days per staff year by
2001, and to six days per staff year by 2003. The Royal Parks
Agency (RPA) is committed to reducing absence to ten days per
employee by 2001 and to nine days per employee by 2003.
Progress
Both DCMS and RPA are taking steps to manage attendance
proactively in the light of the ‘Working Well Together’ report.
In the year to December 2000, DCMS recorded 8.6 days of absence
per employee and the RPA reported 15.37 days of absence per
employee.

Fraud
Target
To improve strategic mechanisms for influencing anti-fraud
standards in sponsored bodies.
Progress
The strategic mechanisms employed are:
the development of a standard framework for financial
memoranda to include compulsory paragraphs on a range of
issues directly related to fraud, and
the implementation of a programme of Financial Management
and Policy Reviews.
The Department has also developed a checklist of key controls that
the Department and its sponsored bodies should have in place to
prevent, detect and investigate fraud, and to deal with the
consequences. These include a fraud policy, code of practice for
Board Members, Code of Conduct for Staff, an Audit Committee
and a personnel handbook.
During the last year the Department revised its Fraud Policy, and
included within it a Fraud Response Plan to help Departmental
managers identify the warning signs that suggest that a fraud
might be occurring, and the appropriate actions that should be
taken in the early stages of a fraud being suspected or discovered.

Procurement
Target
To improve further DCMS procurement practices.
Progress
The Government Procurement card is now in use in some Divisions.
The Department is part of an Office of Government Commerce
(OGC) review to look at consolidating procurement strategies
across government. The OGC initiatives are aimed at greater cost
effectiveness and efficiency in all aspects of procurement, from major
construction work and communications technology to the more
mundane, but high spend, areas of office services and equipment,
and are tending to overtake individual Departmental strategies.
Assets
Target
The Department plans to dispose of surplus properties at
Burlington Gardens and St Pancras at the appropriate time.
The Department will encourage its agencies and NDPBs to make
efficient and effective use of assets which could be disposed of where
proceeds, at least until 2001, could be available for reinvestment to
further the body’s (and the Department’s) objectives.
Progress
The sale of 6 Burlington Gardens has been completed.
The British Library completed the sale of 25 Southampton
Buildings on 20 April 2000 at £18.5 million. The National Film
and Television School completed the sale of Ealing Studios for
£5.7 million and the National Museum of Science and Industry
has completed a land consolidation deal that involves the disposal
of their Foundary Lane warehouse site at the National Railway
Museum, York. A number of other asset sales are also anticipated
over the 2000 Spending Review planning period. Details of the
Department’s asset utilisation strategy can be found in Chapter 4
under the heading ‘Investment and Asset Management’.

1.5 Departmental Modernising Government Action Plan
In response to the Modernising Government White Paper, DCMS
submitted its Action Plan to the Cabinet Office in September 1999.
The plan was developed in line with the five broad strands of the
Modernising Government initiative: better policy making,
responsive public services, quality public services, information age
government, and valuing public service. Each of these strands is
championed by a member of the Department’s Management Board.
Better Policy Making: Developing a strategic framework
Developing policy is an important part of the Department’s role
and we want to be certain that we get it right. Working up a
strategic framework for policy making, which gives all staff access
to comprehensive guidance on best practice, has been one of our
priorities. Over the last year, we have:
developed a computer based guidance list for policy makers,
piloted it and ensured that policy makers, senior civil servants,
and Ministers are now fully aware of the policy making
framework;
developed a guidance note on how to be responsive to DCMS
clients and looked at ways to improve our communications in
this area;
carried out a review of our research and statistical needs, the
outcome of which is detailed in Chapter 4;
invited an independent team to conduct a peer review of our
policy and other systems and are now acting on the
recommendations of the review; and
been developing a new range of training programmes for policy
makers, including courses on policy development, creative
thinking and project management. Policy staff will also be able to
tap into the range of in-house courses that may assist them, for
example creative thinking and presentation skills.

Responsive Public Services
Although the Department provides very little in the way of direct
public services, most of the NDPBs we sponsor do. DCMS is
therefore working with them to ensure that the services they
provide are appropriate to the needs of the consumer. Social
inclusion is a priority for the Government and we are looking at
the best way to address the needs of certain groups to ensure these
services are open to everyone. During 2000 we have:
redeveloped funding agreements with our NDPBs to show a
clear link between spending and outcomes;
been finding out what the public wants by involving them more
in decisions, for example through the establishment of a viewers’
panel to advise on each stage of the switch-over from analogue to
digital television and a tourism consumer group, which has
recommended improved procedures for the display of telephone
charges and the handling of complaints by hoteliers; and
developed a social inclusion action plan to address the needs of
older people, women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities
and others at risk of social exclusion.
Quality Public Services
The Department has begun a rolling programme of NDPB reviews
(including, where appropriate, Better Quality Services reviews)
which will help to ensure that the services provided by its NDPBs
are both responsive and of the highest possible quality.
We aim to complete the first round of reviews by the end of 2004.
In 2000–01, reviews of 12 bodies began, or were continued from
1999–2000, of which one (the Royal Parks Agency) was completed.
The Broadcasting Standards Commission (on the assumption that
proposals in the Communications White Paper will be implemented)
and the National Film and Television School (after it was agreed
during the year that NFTS would move from NDPB to grantfunded status) were taken out of the NDPB review programme.
Information Age Government: Providing e-Government
The Department has responded to the challenge to provide

e-Government by exploring ways to use cutting-edge technology
to enhance existing services and by encouraging beacon projects
already under way in our sectors. We are also exploiting the
potential of e-commerce and knowledge management to develop
new services and are transforming the use of information to
support the objectives of access, education, social inclusion and the
creative economy. Since our last Annual Report, we have developed
the framework for an e-business strategy which:
looks at more effective ways to manage and share information
internally and with others in a number of ways: through the
Knowledge Network, the development of a new customerfocused Departmental website and the redevelopment of our own
Intranet site;
makes the most of technology to improve the way we work and
to underpin flexible working;
reflects the opportunities for improved customer service and
enhanced service delivery options through the use of
technologies such as integrated messaging;
builds on our connection into the Government Secure Intranet,
to allow us to exchange a greater variety of material with other
departments;
identifies progress towards delivering 25 per cent of routine
services electronically to the citizen by 2002;
maps the electronic information services offered by the
Department and the bodies we sponsor;
looks at the potential for the development of e-commerce across
the bodies we sponsor;
explores ways to promote the provision of material and
interactive services connected with artistic and cultural objects
and events throughout the UK, through the Internet and other
forms of digital technology. (More detail is given in Chapter 3.)

Valuing Public Service
The Department and the Royal Parks Agency (RPA) have
embraced the agenda for change set out in Sir Richard Wilson’s
report to the Prime Minister on Civil Service reform with a good
deal of enthusiasm. We have drawn up a comprehensive change
programme aimed at ensuring that we have the right leadership,
people and skills to deliver effective services to our partners and to
the public, and at making DCMS a more attractive employer where
talented people will want to pursue their career.
Our plan was rewarded with a successful bid to the Invest to
Modernise fund, which provided over £1.3 million over two years
to support the reforms in DCMS and the RPA. This has enabled us
to make a good deal of progress under the six themes identified in
Sir Richard’s report:
Providing stronger leadership
All members of the Senior Civil Service and some other senior
managers have received 360 degree feedback to help them
identify their personal and corporate development needs. All
other staff will be given the opportunity to undertake a similar
self awareness exercise during the coming year.
We have introduced a range of new management training
courses for staff including coaching skills and the effective
management of sensitive issues.
Better business planning
Following the Peer Review commissioned by the Department and
extensive discussions with staff, the Department has taken action
to improve the effectiveness of its business planning.
In December, Ministers and the Management Board agreed a
strategic plan setting out their priorities and targets for 2001–04.
Also in December, business planning guidance was issued setting
out arrangements for Divisions, Management Board and
Ministers to review progress and respond flexibly and quickly
in-year to new priorities and emerging pressures.

All staff are being encouraged to be actively involved in business
planning, so that they have ownership of their plan and see it as
an integral part of planning their own work. Divisions will
ensure that staff can make clear links between their forward job
plans and objectives and the divisional business plan. All plans
are to record resources for, and set targets for, ongoing/reactive
work as well as proactive work.
Sharper performance management
We have introduced new appraisal and promotion systems to
support our business objectives more effectively and to promote
a culture of continuous improvement.
We are developing new pay systems to ensure that high
achieving individuals and teams are given the appropriate
incentives and rewards for good performance.
We have also developed new training courses for line managers
to encourage staff to manage these new systems more effectively.
A dramatic improvement in diversity
We have adopted challenging new diversity targets and a
comprehensive action plan for achieving them.
We have embarked on a new programme of diversity training for
all staff and established a new network of equality advisers
across the Department.
A more open DCMS that brings on talent
We are promoting new interchange opportunities with our
partner organisations and have set up 16 new secondments and
attachments with a range of public, private and voluntary sector
organisations.
We have published new recruitment literature, which is helping
to attract more people from outside DCMS to join the
Department.

999059 DCMS Section 1-2001

We have established a new Opportunity scheme for ten junior
staff to help them realise their potential.
We have delivered over 1,500 new training opportunities to all
our staff across a range of management issues including risk
management, creativity and innovation, project management and
making presentations.
A better deal for staff
We have drawn up a new partnership agreement with the trade
unions in the Department, which has built on the good relations
we already enjoy.
We have introduced new flexible working and home working
policies to help staff achieve a better work – life balance.
We have started to track the opinions of staff on working in
DCMS through the first of what will be regular surveys. The
staff survey helped inform a new action plan to improve the way
we work, and we are making good progress in a number of areas.
We have made some important improvements to the physical
environment in which we work including new conference and
gym facilities. A staff restaurant will be opened in the coming
year.
We have undertaken a variety of initiatives aimed at promoting
health awareness among staff and helping to reduce sickness
absence.

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

This chapter reports on the progress the Department, in partnership with others, has
made in the past year in pursuit of the six PSA Objectives listed in Chapter 1.
2.1 Industry sponsorship
Objective: To create an efficient and competitive market by removing
obstacles to growth and unnecessary regulation so as to promote Britain’s
success in the fields of culture, media, sport and tourism at home and
abroad.
DCMS has key responsibilities in promoting efficiency and
competition in the areas of tourism, film, music, broadcasting and
the creative industries, as set out below.
Tourism
The year 2000 was marked by a step change in the way the
Department sponsors this vital sector of the economy. For the
first time, Chris Smith brought together all the Government
Ministers with responsibilities which have an impact on tourism.
The Tourism Summit demonstrated that the whole Government
is committed to the future success of the industry. Action was
identified on better regulation, helping small tourism businesses,
helping rural tourism, and improving transport and sustainability,
recruiting and retaining staff, welcoming visitors to Britain, and
improving quality and consumer choice. Again a first, a network of
officials advising these Ministers was set up and we published
details of how to contact them on a wide range of issues of concern
to the industry.
The British Tourist Authority and the English Tourism Council,
which are funded by DCMS, provided direct support and advice to
the industry in marketing tourism products and services. Their
Annual Reports and the summaries at the end of this report outline
the scope of their work in 2000–01. As well as working alongside
these bodies, however, this year the Department was also actively
involved in efforts to improve skills and retain staff, through the
hospitality careers festival organised by Springboard and through
backing the work of the National Training Organisations for this
sector. The Department set up and helped lead the Tourism
Consumer Group, chaired by the British Hospitality Association,

to address consumer concern about clarity of pricing and the
handling of complaints, and ensured that this was followed up
and implemented.
Crucially, the Department started work on the challenging agenda
of better regulation. Publishing a positive response to the Better
Regulation Task Force’s report on hotels and restaurants,
responsibility was assumed, jointly with MAFF, for seeing that
each of the report’s recommendations is properly addressed.
A series of reviews of most of those regulations that caused
concern is now under way and the Tourism Minister is personally
following up progress on each of them, assisted by representatives
from the industries concerned. The Department has agreed to
build on the work of the English Tourism Council to ensure the
availability of clear and concise guidance about those regulations
that remain in force or are introduced in future.
The Department also worked closely with the English Tourism
Council on the publication of a national set of statistical indicators
for sustainable tourism and part-funded a new ‘one stop shop’
web-site (www.wisegrowth.org.uk/) that is a source of advice on
the development of sustainable tourism practices. We also worked
closely with MAFF on rural development programmes, including
the Rural Enterprise Scheme that will provide £29 million from
April 2001 in targeted assistance for sustainable tourism.
The Department has supported the Creative Industries Export
Promotion Advisory Group (CIEPAG) initiative, under which the
Heritage and Tourism Cluster Group was established to create and
promote awareness at home and abroad of the export earning
opportunities for British expertise in heritage preservation and
exploitation.
Film
The Film Council became fully operational in April 2000, and, in
May, published the first stage of its strategy for creating a
sustainable British film industry. This included proposals for:

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

a major new film development fund to support the development
of high quality, innovative and commercially attractive
screenplays;
the Premiere Production Fund to facilitate the production of
popular mainstream British films;
a New Cinema Fund to back radical and experimental film-makers;
the Film Training Fund to support training for scriptwriters and
development executives;
a strategy to expand business and creative relationships with
European partners;
a programme to stimulate the export of British films around
the globe;
an expansion of the British Film Office in Los Angeles; and
the creation of a market intelligence unit to provide authoritative
statistics about the British film industry.
The Department, alongside DTI, the Film Council and
representatives of the industry, has commissioned research during
the year into developments in digital technology and how the
production, distribution and exhibition sectors of the film industry
might best take advantage of them. A feature of this initiative was a
demonstration of digital technology that has toured the country.
Also with DTI support, the Department is working to raise
awareness in the film industry of the opportunities afforded by the
development of digital technologies. Towards this end, the
Department and the Film Council have funded Screen Digest to
prepare a report looking at how this technology will impact on
production, distribution and exhibition.
The Secretary of State asked the British Screen Advisory Council
(BSAC) to set up a working group on ethnic minority employment

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

4/3/01

19:33

Page 45

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

45

in the film industry, to explore the barriers to the employment of
ethnic minorities both in front of and behind the camera. A report
has been prepared and consultations are under way prior to
recommendations being presented to Government early in the
summer of 2001.
Music
The Music Industry Forum was set up by the Secretary of State
to involve leading players from across the industry in the
Department’s sponsorship agenda. Work has been undertaken
during the year to follow up the Forum’s recommendations,
including:
a report on the impact of new technologies on the industry,
Consumers Call the Tune; and
research by Kingston University into how small and medium
sized enterprises (SMEs) in the music industry can gain access
to finance.
The Department has worked closely with DfEE and the music
industry to ensure the success of the New Deal for Musicians,
which celebrated its first anniversary in October.
Broadcasting
The consultation exercise on the joint DTI/DCMS
Communications White Paper was completed in June, and in July
reports were received from a group of experts on communications,
chaired by Sir Quentin Thomas. The experts were asked to
consider the following guiding principles for the White Paper:
the creation of the most dynamic market possible for
communications services, especially in the light of the growth of
the e-economy;
ensuring universal access to diverse services of the highest
quality; and

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

guarding consumer interests – protection, choice and value for
money.
The White Paper was published on 12 December 2000.
Responses to the consultation and the reports of the experts are
available on the White Paper website, www.communications
whitepaper.gov.uk
The Government’s response to the Creative Industries Task Force
Television Export Inquiry (November 1999) was published in July
and good progress has since been made both by Government and
the industry in taking issues forward. The Action Plan is being
regularly monitored and updated.
In Phase II of the inquiry, consultants were appointed to undertake
an in-depth look at the programme supply market in the digital
age, with an emphasis on realising the potential of UK creative
talent and fostering competition within the industry. Their report,
which informed the Communications White Paper, was published
on the Departmental website in December.
An independent study of the use of the FM radio spectrum was
commissioned by the DTI’s Radiocommunications Agency, the
BBC and the Radio Authority and published in June 2000.
The Department made an active contribution to negotiations on
the EU Electronic Communications Directive, which are mainly the
responsibility of the DTI. Our objective is to secure outcomes
(where content issues overlap with infrastructure) that place UK
broadcasters, and particularly public service broadcasters, in the
most favourable position to operate in the new convergent
technological landscape.
The Creative Industries
The Department published and took forward the recommendations
of a number of reports, including:
Your Creative Future – the first ever careers guidance booklet on

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

4/3/01

19:33

Page 47

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

47

the creative industries. Compiled in partnership with the Design
Council and the Arts Council for England, the booklet was
distributed to all secondary schools, colleges and universities,
and career advisers. A web version (www.yourcreative
future.com) followed later in the year;
Connecting Creativity with Capital – the report of the National
Finance Conference to bring together creative businesses with
those from the financial and business support sectors. The report
set out a series of recommendations to improve relationships and
make the market work more effectively;
Intellectual Property – the report of a Creative Industries Task
Force sub-group, chaired by Dr Kim Howells (DTI). Its remit
was to consider ways of improving awareness of, and education
about, intellectual property (IP). The report recommended
making the language of IP more accessible, undertaking a
benchmarking exercise on current levels of awareness, creating
an IP ‘portal’, and devising appropriate material about IP for the
school curriculum;
The Regional Dimension – the report of another sub-group which
focused on the contribution creative industries could make to
regional economies. The report summarised the findings of three
workshops held in Leeds, Coventry and Bristol which considered
how, in different parts of the country, the potential of the
industries could best be realised. The report sets out a
challenging agenda for Regional Development Agencies (RDAs)
and other players;
Snapshot of a Rolling Wave – the report of an inquiry into the
threats and the opportunities arising from the Internet for
creative businesses. The report’s recommendations covered areas
such as legal and regulatory issues; tax and fiscal issues; skills,
training and education; strengthening capacity; and the provision
of information and advice.
Together with Exports: Our Hidden Potential and the TV Exports
Inquiry published late last year, this formed a body of analysis on

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

48

2

4/3/01

19:33

Page 48

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

issues impacting on the creative industries. DCMS is now focused
on turning this analysis into action and ensuring that the
recommendations in each report are put into effect.
Mainstreaming
This year has been one in which awareness of the creative
industries, the breadth of activities they cover, their contribution to
the economic well-being of the UK, and their international
reputation for excellence grew. The needs, and the potential, of
these industries have been recognised increasingly at national,
regional and local levels of government. One of the Department’s
key goals has been to encourage the ‘mainstreaming’ of efforts, to
ensure that work on the creative industries is not seen as simply a
DCMS issue. Over the course of the last year, there have been a
number of encouraging signs:
the positive response from the Department for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR) and the Regional
Development Agencies (RDAs) to the challenges set out in the
Regional Dimension report, ensuring appropriate support
provision for creative businesses within the regions;
the support from the Patent Office in taking forward our work
on IP, helping to ensure an increased awareness of the
importance of IP rights to longer term creativity;
the support of Trade Partners UK in developing the export
agenda, establishing a joint secretariat with the Creative
Industries Unit to support the work of industry cluster groups
(Content, Design, Performing Arts, Heritage and Tourism);
the support of the Small Business Service and the University for
Industry for the development of appropriate support mechanisms
for creative businesses;
the creation of the Britain Abroad Task Force by the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office to help promote the UK’s creativity
and innovation overseas;

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

Scottish Enterprise’s selection of the creative industries as one of
its key clusters, and plans to provide £25 million funding to this
sector in the next five years; and
the publication in Northern Ireland of the Unlocking Creativity
report, supported by four departments in the assembly, which
puts the creative industries at the heart of the economic agenda.
The Arts
This year saw the publication by DCMS of Getting Britain Giving to
Culture, introducing a new simpler and improved tax regime for
giving to cultural charities, underlining the Government’s
commitment to recognising and encouraging private support for
cultural charities. The changes make it possible for many charities
operating in the arts or heritage sectors to increase their income
and raise their profile.
The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts
The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts
(NESTA) was established in 1998 with an endowment of £200
million from the National Lottery. NESTA’s objectives are to help
talented individuals (or groups of individuals) in the fields of science,
technology or the arts achieve their potential; to help to turn
inventions or ideas in the fields of science, technology or the arts into
products and services that can be effectively exploited and the rights
to which can be adequately protected; and to contribute to public
knowledge and appreciation of science, technology and the arts.
NESTA runs three programmes:
Fellowships – aimed at providing exceptionally talented
individuals with the time and space to pursue their creative goals
and develop their talent through tailored support worth up to
£75,000 over three to five years;
Invention and Innovation – designed to help some 50–100
imaginative ideas and projects each year to access practical help
and professional input. Awards are worth up to £50,000 (with
up to £100,000 for exceptional projects).

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

Education – supporting projects that will help foster creativity
and pioneer new approaches to learning and teaching.
NESTA made its first full awards in May 2000, when 24 projects
totalling £2.4 million were announced. These comprised 13
Fellowships, seven Invention and Innovation awards, and four
Education projects and included funding for innovations ranging
from keyhole surgery to amphibious vehicles and for individuals
with interests as diverse as interactive technology, poetry, filmmaking, astrophysics and science centres. Further awards were
made in 2000 and a second round of over 30 awards was
announced in February 2001.
2.2 Broadening access
Objective: To broaden access for this and future generations to a rich and
varied cultural and sporting life and to our distinctive built environment.
The Department wants to increase access to and participation in
the cultural and sporting life of the nation, while maintaining the
quality of the experience that it offers. The Department believes
that everyone should have the opportunity to develop their
potential and enrich their lives and that of their community
through cultural and sporting activity, and it therefore works with
others inside and outside Government both to create greater
opportunity and to increase the extent to which it is taken up.
The Department’s policy on access, moreover, also contributes to
the promotion of learning, employment and social inclusion. We
are promoting greater participation at every level in cultural and
leisure activities across the whole range of DCMS responsibilities.
Wherever possible, the DCMS access aim has been encapsulated in
a key overall target for each sphere of activity, that, for example, to
create 300,000 opportunities to experience the arts, and DCMS is
developing measures of participation across the fields of culture
and leisure to monitor how patterns of participation vary and
whether increasing participation in one field is countered by a
decline elsewhere.

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

Broad targets on their own, however, are not enough. The work
of extending access implies specific programmes targeted at
particular means of improvement within the overall picture. Those
programmes are in turn specific to particular institutions or areas
of activity, and will involve the access issues most relevant to them.
The Department is pursuing these aims, in partnership with others
in the public, commercial and voluntary sectors, by various means:
DCMS policies, including the strategies on sport and tourism,
and access to libraries, museums and galleries;
the targeting of directly funded DCMS programmes and
running costs;
the inclusion (and monitoring) of targets – as well as the
development of shared strategies for promoting access – in
funding agreements with sponsored bodies and in the terms of
secondary grant-giving;
the incorporation of access aims in Lottery distributors’
strategies;
encouraging the inclusion of access themes in local authority
cultural strategies and library plans/standards;
encouraging the inclusion of such themes in the regional cultural
strategies produced by the new Regional Cultural Consortiums;
other indirect policy persuasion, including the development of
best practice via QUEST.
As set out above, increasing access means DCMS and its ‘family’ of
organisations breaking down barriers to participation. The
following paragraphs give some examples of the work being done:
(a) to improve physical access and proximity, especially to people
with limited mobility and/or physical disabilities.

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

During 2000, DCMS worked with other departments on the issues
faced by people with disabilities. We held a conference in July
specifically to identify and promote best practice in physical and
intellectual access, employment and participation in DCMS sectors,
and the Department has developed an action plan to promote this
best practice. There is already much good work being done:
through the Sportsmatch programme, in which Sport England
will match private sponsorship pound for pound, there will be a
three year programme to develop a structure that will increase
the participation in football training of more specialist coaches
who are sensitive to the needs of people with disabilities, and
create playing opportunities and a competition structure. It is
part of the English Federation of Disability Sport’s (EFDS)
Ability Counts programme;
the DCMS/Wolfson Reader Development Programme funds
initiatives to promote reading and will fund the National Library
for the Blind’s project to provide an integrated package of
services for visually impaired people and distribute it to libraries
in England. Their ‘A Touch Of ’ project will cover a range of
initiatives, making available, for example, samples for Braille
readers and a website designed for use by disabled people.
Experts at the National Library for the Blind in Stockport will
be working with library professionals across the country to
enhance capacity and awareness;
in museums and galleries there are many examples of good
practice in promoting not only access for people with disabilities
but policies to promote participation in their events. Tyne and
Wear Museums have been developing access audits and, in
particular, access audits done by and for people with learning
disabilities. The Whitechapel Art Gallery has instituted arts
sessions led by artists with disabilities for able bodied and
disabled participants alike. The National Maritime Museum and
Royal Observatory have developed a database of contacts for
people who are deaf or whose hearing is impaired and will
provide information about any signed events;

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

in film we are working through the Arts Council’s Disability
Film Festival. The new Film Council is currently carrying out
an audit of the industry to gauge the participation of disabled
people in all aspects of film production.
With the aim of preserving physical access for all children to
sporting facilities, a Sports Pitch Monitoring Group has been
created to monitor playing field disposals and ensure that the
increased protection put in place for playing fields is working well.
(b) to improve remote access, using information technology and
the media, particularly the broadcast media. For example:
The Department worked with the broadcasting industry and
consumer groups to produce a set of key messages from
consumers about the benefits of digital television which the
Secretary of State launched at the Royal Television Society
Autumn Symposium on 31 December 2000. The Department
aims to continue working with the industry where possible on
their own promotions, and has established a target of 95 per cent
for the take-up of digital television by 2006–10. Current
take-up is 26 per cent, up from 11 per cent this time last year.
In May 1999 Janet Anderson requested a progress report from
all broadcasters on their plans to maximise access to digital
broadcasting, including the provision of subtitling. In January
2000 Ministers announced a review of the statutory targets for
subtitling, signing and audio description on digital television.
A consultation paper was published in July following preliminary
discussions with interested parties. The results of the review
were published on the Departmental website in January 2001
and hard copies were sent to people who responded to the
consultation paper. As a result, we concluded that the target for
the provision of subtitling on Digital Terrestrial Television
services should be raised from 50 per cent of programmes by the
tenth anniversary of the start of the service, to 80 per cent by
the tenth anniversary. We have also proposed that these targets
should be applied to satellite and cable broadcasters, as
legislative opportunities permit.

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

One of the Department’s original PSA targets was to double the
number of Internet connections in public libraries by 2000,
and ensure that at least 75 per cent of libraries had connections
to the net by 2002. Progress against this target has exceeded
expectations. From a baseline of 5 per cent in 1997, the
percentage of static public libraries with Internet connections
had already reached 41 per cent by December 2000. This
encouraging rate of progress has allowed the target to be revised
upwards to 80 per cent by December 2001 and 100 per cent by
December 2002.
The 24-Hour Museum, the electronic gateway to UK museums,
galleries and heritage attractions, launched in May 1999,
enjoyed a successful second year of operation. It now provides
information on over 2,500 institutions and is receiving over
220,000 hits per week. Known as ‘the first national museum on
the Web’ and among the leading cultural websites of the UK, the
Museum is managed jointly by the Campaign for Museums and
mda and is funded by DCMS (with support from DfEE towards
the new Curriculum Navigator launched in May 2000). It has
been formally established as a company limited by guarantee and
as an independent charity. A new Director of Development was
appointed in November 2000 and an Editor was appointed in
January 2001 to take the Museum through the next phase of its
expansion. (The 24-Hour Museum can be found at
www.24hourmuseum.org.uk)
English Heritage will be providing virtual access to every listed
building via the £4 million Images of England project supported
by the Heritage Lottery Fund. By 2002, digital images of
England’s 360,000 listed buildings will be accessible to an
international audience over the Internet. During the summer of
1999, 484 volunteer members of the Royal Photographic Society
took the first 37,000 photographs in what will become one of the
world’s largest on-line image banks.
(c) to increase economic access, via revised pricing policies.
The major initiative directed towards this end has been the

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

4/3/01

19:33

Page 55

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

55

introduction of free access to museums and galleries. On 1 April
1999, free admission was introduced for under-16s at all museums
and galleries sponsored by the Department, and the number of
under-16 visitors has increased by nearly 10% since. On 1 April
2000, the scheme’s remit was widened to include pensioners, and
free admission for the over-60s was brought in at five DCMSsponsored museums and galleries where there had previously been
a charge. Another institution introduced this measure at its main
headquarters museum only, and it was also initiated at branches of
two further national museums where the over-60s had previously
been required to pay.
(d) to increase the pool of potential participants, through
explanation, education, presentation and marketing.
The Arts Council’s New Audiences programme is designed to
bring new audiences to the arts and take new art to audiences
throughout the country. Over 300 projects have now been
developed and funded across a range of art forms, testing a
variety of innovative approaches to audience development.
The underlying principles are to: build on success; target those
with fewer opportunities for artistic experiences; encourage a
lifelong arts experience; promote innovation and enable
consolidation; broaden the range and depth of experience; and
find partners. It has made available over 1.5 million extra
opportunities to experience the arts.
Historic Royal Palaces have continued to improve links with the
local community and to make the Palaces accessible to more
of the population. At the Tower of London, for example, free
educational visits have been offered to children in the London
boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Southwark, whilst over
20 specially designed programmes have been targeted at children
for whom English may be a second language. At the other Palaces
the existing educational resources continue to be expanded to
provide activities for visitors of all ages, nationalities and needs.
As well as a comprehensive programme of taught sessions for
schools, Historic Royal Palaces offer services ranging from
sensory tours of Hampton Court Palace for the disabled to
adult leisure learning.

English Heritage has launched the new Historic Buildings,
Monuments, Parks and Gardens grant scheme, which offers
£40 million over three years to buildings and monuments at
risk, grants to private owners and grants for repair projects
with significant social and regenerative benefits.
The Department continues to co-ordinate the implementation of
the Stonehenge Master Plan, which aims to restore the setting
of this World Heritage Site and improve visitor understanding
and enjoyment. The plan was published in June 2000 and the
Department has made substantial additional funding available to
enable English Heritage to acquire the proposed new visitor
centre site at Countess East, Amesbury.
The year 2000 has seen a stunning array of major openings at
the DCMS sponsored museums and galleries. The National
Portrait Gallery (NPG) 2000 project and its dramatic new
sweeping escalator is encouraging visitors to view previously
under-visited parts of the NPG’s collection; the Imperial War
Museum Holocaust Gallery provided a poignant and hardhitting portrayal of the twentieth century’s greatest man-made
tragedy; the culmination of the Wallace Collection’s Centenary
Project puts on display previously little seen parts of its
exquisite collection of fine art and crafts; the Science Museum’s
Wellcome Wing showcases some of the most striking examples
of man’s ingenuity in the fields of contemporary science and
technology and the opening of Tate Modern provides a stunning
new home for one of the world’s great contemporary art
collections. As well as providing improved access to their
national collections, these developments have provided much
better public facilities and will help the institutions to improve
key educational services.
The creation of the Football Foundation, in partnership with the
Football Association, FA Premier League and Sport England,
will enable funding to go to grassroots football facilities across
England and to educational community projects, both of which
will assist the Department’s drive for greater social inclusion.

The establishment of Supporters Direct will assist groups of
football supporters to join together and form Trusts to take an
equity stake in their local clubs.
The Government agreed to extend the UK’s Public Lending
Right (PLR) scheme to make payments to authors resident
anywhere in the European Economic Zone and legislation was
brought into effect from July 2000. It is hoped that this will lead
to the establishment of reciprocal arrangements. We have also
provided funds over the next two years to restore the real-terms
value of the PLR payments to authors.
(e) to increase responsiveness to the needs of potential
participants, for example by gathering feedback from residents,
through a Best Value Performance Indicator, on the cultural and
leisure services provided by their local authority.
2.3 Education
Objective: To develop the educational potential of all the nation’s cultural
and sporting resources; raise standards of cultural education and training;
ensure an adequate skills supply for the creative industries and tourism;
and encourage the take up of educational opportunities.
Over the past year, DCMS has been working closely with its
sponsored bodies as well as DfEE and other Government
departments and agencies to develop further its educational
interests and to support the Government’s drive to raise standards
and increase opportunities in education and lifelong learning more
widely. Building on the foundations laid in previous years,
substantial progress has been made in developing the huge
educational potential of the cultural sector and placing creativity,
the arts and sport at the centre of the educational debate. In
addition, a new spotlight has been placed on skills, covering both
the vocational skills required by our business sectors and the
significant contribution that those sectors can make to addressing
the serious shortfall in adult basic skills across the country. Details
of the Department’s educational activity in the past year are set out

MARTA MARCE
Marta studied painting at the Royal College of Art. Her sources are board
games and computer games using basic geometrical shapes and structures
as strategies. She prepares the two-dimensional surface for a game and
creates the rules. Changing the rules slightly gives a completely unforeseen
result, allowing chance to participate. Colour is the most intuitive aspect of
her work, which she describes as ‘passion combined with experimentation’.

below, in the form of an overview of Department-wide
contributions to the Government’s wider educational agenda,
followed by summaries of the main developments in the various
DCMS sectors.
DCMS’ contribution to the Government’s wider educational agenda
Early Learning
Children’s Play
Children enjoy music, art and physical activity from an early age,
and participation in play activities is not only enjoyable but also
vital for the development of important social skills and physical
coordination. The Department is therefore working closely
with DfEE and with a range of experts in the field to develop
information, training and communication networks among
playworkers and to promote best practice.
The Department has an annual budget of £500,000 for children’s
play, and funding over the next two years has been allocated to four
organisations. £60,000 has been given in sponsorship over two
years to the National Children’s Bureau to run the Children’s Play
Information Service, which offers advice and guidance to the public
on all aspects of play; £72,000 has been given to the Children’s
Play Council to produce 12 issues of Playtoday, a free bi-monthly
magazine for the sector; £350,000 has been given over each of the
next two years to SPRITO (the National Training Organisation
(NTO) for the sports and recreational industries) to develop a
coherent and flexible playworker training and education
programme which will also endorse qualifications submitted by the
Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA); and £140,000 in
research project funding has been given to the Children’s Play
Council. The research is focused on identifying, increasing
understanding of and promoting best practice within the context of
existing local authority work, and taking account of key features
such as local transport networks. The research is looking for
examples of provision that will offer enhanced play opportunities in
ways that support the Government’s strategic goals. It will also be
the first systematic exploration of the impact of play initiatives on
key public policy areas such as juvenile crime.

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

Sure Start
As well as funding other organisations to deliver results in the
field of children’s play, DCMS is involved in Sure Start, the
Government’s programme aimed at helping under-fives in areas
suffering high levels of deprivation get a first-class start in life.
Sure Start funding is controlled by local communities, but DCMS
is working with DfEE and others to ensure that the positive
benefits that sporting and cultural activities can bring are fully
recognised and made as widely available as possible through this
programme. Each Sure Start area has on-site headquarters, and the
Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) is
working with DfEE to ensure that these buildings provide a good
environment for small children and their parents.
Culture and Creativity in Teaching and Learning
The Department has continued to work closely with DfEE and
QCA colleagues during the implementation of the outcomes of
the review of the National Curriculum that took place in 1999.
As a result of this review, the Curriculum Framework, introduced
in September 2000, places a greater emphasis on creative and
cultural education; reinforces the position of art, music and
physical education as subjects within the school curriculum; and
gives increased recognition to the status of drama and media
within English.
All Our Futures: Creativity, Culture and Education (NACCCE Report)
The Department has also been working closely with DfEE on
implementing the commitments given in the Government’s
response to the All Our Futures: Creativity, Culture and Education
report by the National Advisory Committee on Creative and
Cultural Education (NACCCE). This report was originally
commissioned jointly by Chris Smith and David Blunkett to feed
into the QCA Review of the National Curriculum. A report on
progress was produced in September 2000 and is available on the
DCMS website (www.culture.gov.uk).
Further Curriculum Development
Although the QCA does not plan to carry out another big review
of the National Curriculum, it has been working closely with DfEE

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

61

and DCMS to look at the quality of teaching and learning in a
number of specific areas, including the arts, creativity and
school and community sport. The aim will be to provide teachers
with guidance on best practice and advise on any changes that are
required to the curriculum framework to facilitate this.
Study Support
Following the publication of Extending Opportunity: A National
Framework for Study Support, dedicated funding has been made
available to promote effective study support partnerships. The New
Opportunities Fund (NOF), one of DCMS’ sponsored bodies, is
putting £205 million into supporting out of school hours learning
projects across the UK by 2002. Many of the grants awarded by
NOF include projects involving sports, arts, dance, music, design
technology and media studies. The Department has also been
working closely with DfEE to encourage creative partnerships
between schools and a wide range of public, private and voluntary
organisations. DfEE has provided £2.5 million to fund 138
innovative projects through its Partners for Study Support action
research programme. Many of these projects focus on arts, sports,
libraries and museums, and the Department is taking a keen
interest in the lessons that are emerging about building effective
partnerships between schools and the cultural and sporting sectors.
Space for Sport and Arts
Following a successful joint DCMS/DfEE bid to the Capital
Modernisation Fund (CMF) for £75 million to be augmented by
Lottery funding, Chris Smith announced in April 2000 that up to
£150 million of funding would be available in the areas of greatest
need to provide around 300 new sports and arts facilities in
primary schools, for the use of both pupils and the wider
community, under the Space for Sport and Arts Scheme (SSA).
Further details of the future development of this scheme are given
in Chapter 3.
Review of Initial Teacher Training
The Department and its sponsored bodies have made a significant
contribution to the Teacher Training Agency’s (TTA) ongoing
review of the Circular governing initial teacher training (ITT) in

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

England. The issues raised by DCMS sectors included concerns
about the breadth of the curriculum in certain subjects, the lack of
time available within courses to cover key aspects of DCMS-related
subjects and the increasing sense that training courses have
focused on a narrow, subject-specific concept of teaching at the
expense of a broader, cultural dimension. A series of positive and
constructive sectoral meetings were held in the spring and early
summer and a number of DCMS-related sectors, including sport,
the arts, film and museums and galleries, are now working on
materials that may be made available to support teacher trainers
and their trainees alongside the new Circular, which is expected to
come into force in 2002.
Further and Higher Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills
Further and Higher Education
The Department has been keeping in close touch with DfEE on the
establishment of the new national and local Learning and Skills
Councils (LSCs), which will take over responsibility for all aspects
of the funding and delivery of Post-16 Education (with the
exception of Higher Education) from 2001. The Department has
arranged for the Regional Cultural Consortiums to be listed among
the bodies the LSC is required to consult in the development of the
local delivery structure, and it has also encouraged DCMS sectors
to put forward candidates for the national and local LSC Boards to
try to ensure that these sectors, which include the creative
industries, arts, media, cultural heritage and tourism, are well
represented in the new structure.
The Department has also held positive initial discussions with the
Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) about
issues of mutual interest, including university museums (DCMS
contributed to the Arts and Humanities Research Board’s
consultation on future funding in this area), the role that digitised
National Museum collections might play in the e-University,
community use of university libraries and the place of media
studies courses within higher education.
Lifelong Learning and Skills
A useful first round of discussions was held during 2000 with the

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

4/3/01

19:33

Page 63

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

63

IMPACT grouping of DCMS-related National Training
Organisations (NTOs) and DCMS is looking at ways of
strengthening the support it can provide to these bodies in order
to improve further the skills development infrastructure of the
Department’s sectors. In this context, Chris Smith delivered a wellreceived keynote speech at the National Skills Show at the National
Exhibition Centre in Birmingham in July, and further work is in
hand with UK Skills, the organiser of the show, in key areas such as
setting up a Craft Skills Forum to support the craft and
conservation skills upon which much of our National Heritage
depends. The Department is also closely involved in the
development of a National Skills Agenda in response to the work of
the Skills Task Force, which delivered its final report in
the summer. Details of the work DCMS is doing to support the
activities of the various NTOs in its sectors are given in the
relevant sectoral entries below.
The Department is also working with DfEE and other
Government departments on developing a National Adult Basic
Skills Strategy, in response to the findings of the Moser Report,
A Fresh Start, which noted that one in five adults of working age
(around 7 million people in England) cannot do basic tasks such as
look up a plumber in the Yellow Pages or read the instructions on a
medicine bottle. DCMS sectors, such as the arts, media and sport,
can and do make an important contribution to addressing adult
basic skills needs. The Department is currently mapping the work
of its sponsored bodies to identify the contribution currently made
by these sectors and to consider ways in which this important
work can be supported and extended.
Sectoral Developments
As well as contributing, with increasing effectiveness, to the full
range of broad Governmental educational initiatives, DCMS and its
sponsored bodies have worked hard to develop the education and
training activities within the broad group of sectors for which they
are responsible. This work has started from differing levels of
previous engagement and the nature of these activities has
accordingly varied but, as the following paragraphs show, a great
deal of work has been done and substantial progress has been made.

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

The Arts
Artsmark
In January 2000, Chris Smith and David Blunkett announced the
new Artsmark scheme to encourage schools not only to provide
quality arts opportunities for young people but also to develop
and support teachers in their delivery. As a benchmark of
excellence, Artsmark will aim to improve standards of arts
education provision, raise its profile nationally, within schools,
arts organisations and communities, and encourage effective
partnerships between schools and arts agencies and other
organisations. It will be awarded by the Arts Council of England
following a school-led application process, and schools that receive
an Artsmark will be able to promote their recognised standard of
arts education throughout their community. All schools – primary,
secondary, maintained, special and independent – will be eligible to
apply, at one of three developmental levels of the scheme. Artsmark
has been piloted across the country and will be available to all
schools from January 2001.
Music Standards Fund
The Department has worked closely with DfEE in developing the
Music Standards Fund, which gives local education authorities
(LEAs) the opportunity to bid for funds to start a Music Service
or, for those LEAs that already have a Music Service, to expand it.
Since the introduction of the Fund, 95 per cent of LEAs
throughout the country are receiving funds to provide
instrumental tuition for pupils. In July 2000, the Associated Board
of the Royal Schools of Music reported that there are signs of an
arrest in the decline in the numbers of young people playing a
musical instrument. In September 2000, the Government
announced its continuing commitment to the Music Standards
Fund with an increase in funding from 2001 to £60 million per
year. This level of funding will be sustained until at least 2003–4,
ensuring that every LEA in the country can offer children the
chance to learn to play musical instruments.
National Foundation for Youth Music
The National Foundation for Youth Music was set up to promote
and develop music opportunities for young people, up to and

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

including 18 years old. Since its launch by the Prime Minister in
June1999, the work of the Foundation has been broadening. The
Foundation is now working in a wide range of areas to ensure
that all young people get the opportunity to make music. These
include: Singing Challenge award programmes; the UK’s first ever
nationwide Instrument Amnesty, which has resulted in members of
the public donating more than 6,000 working instruments they no
longer play to give a new generation the opportunity to make
music; the Music Maker, programme which is looking to fund
skilled musicians and music leaders who will create imaginative
and music-making opportunities for children and young people
within their communities; and the First Steps initiative, which has
been developed to encourage very young children to have a musical
start in life.
From Policy to Partnership
In March 2000, the Arts Council for England (ACE) and the
Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) published guidance
on building partnerships between schools and arts practitioners,
entitled From Policy to Partnership: Developing the Arts in Schools.
The publication, to which DCMS contributed and which was
endorsed by both Chris Smith and David Blunkett, has been
written to help schools consolidate and build on their existing arts
teaching and learning, and establish partnerships to meet their
own needs and enrich their arts provision. This follows on from
Partnerships for Learning, a guide to evaluating arts education
projects, which was published by ACE in October 1999.
Dance and Drama
The Dance and Drama Awards Scheme, administered by DfEE,
continues to provide assistance to the most talented students,
regardless of means, to access high quality accredited courses
at approved specialist independent dance and drama schools.
The scheme provides places for 820 students per year.
Metier – the National Training Organisation for the performing arts
The Department continues to support Metier in its work to
increase the skills base of the arts and entertainment sector. Metier
published the sector’s learning targets to 2002 and Arts Skills 2000

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

identified future priorities for education and training in the arts
and entertainment industries. The Department also sponsored
Metier research into leadership and management in the arts and the
skills and training needs for the music industry in the twenty-first
century.
Creative Partnerships
In July 2000, Chris Smith announced funding of £40 million over
two years (starting in April 2002) for 16 Creative Partnerships to
provide exciting, challenging opportunities for young people to
experience, learn from and enjoy artistic and creative activities, the
proposals for which are set out in Chapter 3 below.
Sport
A Sporting Future for All and the Government’s Action Plan
In April 2000, DCMS published its sport strategy, A Sporting
Future for All, setting out the Government’s vision for sport.
The strategy addressed all levels of sport, from the grass roots to
world class performance. School sport was identified as a priority,
and the paper outlined the new measures set out elsewhere in
this report. A Sporting Future for All also stressed the value of
continued participation in sport beyond school age. Immediately
after publication, a sport strategy Implementation Group was set
up involving individuals from National Governing Bodies of Sport,
school sport professionals, local authority sport development
officers and others prominent in the world of sport with a wealth
of experience. They were charged with producing an action
plan for sport founded on the principles of the strategy. The
Implementation Group reported to Ministers in December.
Their recommendations form the basis of A Sporting Future for
All: the Government’s Plan for Sport, published in March 2001.
Implementation of this comprehensive plan for the future of sport
in education, sport in the community and world class sport has
already started. Progress will be monitored and reported on
annually, by a panel composed of members of the original
implementation groups, from April 2002.
School Sport Coordinators
One of the key commitments in the sports strategy was the

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

4/3/01

19:33

Page 67

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

67

establishment of School Sport Coordinators. Based in secondary
schools in areas of greatest need, the 600 Coordinators
(subsequently increased to 1,000) will be experienced PE teachers
with a mission to improve the opportunities for young people to
take part in competitive sport and to experience a wide range of
activities. The preferred model centres around a Specialist Sport
College (there are currently 84 across the country, and this is
expected to rise to at least 200 by 2004) which will release an
expert PE practitioner from timetable for two or three days per
week to manage the development of the local partnership or
‘family’ of schools. This Partnership Development Manager will
liaise with a School Sport Coordinator in each of four or five
secondary schools within the partnership. The Coordinators will
also be released from timetable two days a week to coordinate and
drive development of sport in the secondary school and in
associated feeder primary or special schools. In each of these linked
primary or special schools, a Primary Link Teacher will be released
from timetable one day a month to plan and implement programmes
and to undertake training in sport and physical education.
School Sport Alliance
In order to facilitate closer, more joined-up working between
DCMS and DfEE and to share the experience and expertise of the
key partners in the field of school sport, the two Departments have
established a new forum, the School Sport Alliance. The Alliance is
a partnership consisting of DCMS, DfEE, the New Opportunities
Fund (NOF), the Youth Sport Trust and Sport England. It will
bring together the key stakeholders in the future development of
sport in schools with a mission to realise the vision set out in
A Sporting Future for All, and set a strategic framework for the
funding of sport in schools through the Exchequer and the
National Lottery.
Volunteering
The Department has been successful in its recent bid to the Active
Community Fund to match the £4 million Exchequer funding for
Sport Volunteers. £7 million will now enable schemes run by the
Youth Sport Trust, the British Sport Trust, Sport England and the
sports National Governing Bodies to develop additional resources

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

and train up to 30,000 extra volunteers over each of the two years
2002–3 and 2003–4. Most of the funding will go towards training
and developing volunteers to act as mentors, coaches, officials and
sports administrators, creating a clearly defined – and supported –
pathway for young people wanting to be involved in sport and
possibly progress to sporting careers. 15 per cent of the volunteers
will be older people who will provide role models for young people.
The announcement by the Home Office in February that volunteers
will be exempted from disclosure fees for Criminal Record Bureau
checks will be widely welcomed in the voluntary sector and will have
a beneficial impact on the DCMS Sport Volunteers programme.
Libraries, Museums, Galleries and Archives
Public Libraries and ICT-based learning
Following the publication in March 2000 of the report Empowering
the Learning Community by the Education Task Group of the
Library and Information Commission (which has been replaced
by Resource), DCMS and DfEE have established an interdepartmental Steering Group to consider, and advise Ministers on
the report’s recommendations. They are being assisted in this work
by an External Advisory Group drawn from the library and
education sectors. The Government has undertaken to respond by
February 2001 to the recommendations in the report relating to
the coordination of library resources in support of lifelong
learning. A Conference on this subject will be held in London on
27–28 March 2001.
The Department is uniquely placed, through its responsibility for
the Public Libraries Network, to play a key role in fulfilling the
Government’s wider vision for a learning society through the
opportunities afforded by Information and Communications
Technology (ICT). Through the People’s Network programme, all
4,300 public libraries in the UK will be online and linked to the
National Grid for Learning by the end of 2002. Public libraries
linked to the Internet form an integral part of the Government’s
wider UK Online programme, which aims to give Internet access
to everybody in the UK who wants it by 2005. The first training in
ICT for librarians under the People’s Network programme, which
is designed to improve access to lifelong learning through the

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

69

Internet for public library users, began in September 2000 with
£20 million of funding from the New Opportunities Fund. By the
end of 2002, 27,000 librarians will have received training to at least
the European Computer Driving Licence standard, together with
training in learner support. The NOF Digitisation programme for
production of digitised materials in support of citizenship, basic
skills and cultural enrichment met with an enthusiastic response.
Announcements of awards from this £50 million programme will
be made in 2001.
The DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge Fund was created
in 1997 as a partnership between DCMS and the philanthropic
Wolfson Foundation in order to enhance the facilities and services
offered by English public libraries. The Fund had two programmes
for 2000–01: supporting projects promoting reading as a skill and
pleasure, thereby building on the work generated by the National
Year of Reading (1998–99), and, through the Wolfson British
History Programme, supporting projects that enhance libraries’
ability to contribute to the nation’s understanding of its recent
history. The first 33 awards to reader development projects were
made in June, to projects working with families, prisoners,
travellers, health professionals and homeless people among other
groups. The awards totalled £1,902,949, and a number of these
had a significant ICT dimension. In November, 16 awards, totalling
£459,978, from the British History Programme were announced.
Both programmes will be repeated in 2001–02, and an evaluation
study of the reader development projects funded this year will be
completed and disseminated.
Museums, Galleries and Archives
In May 2000, DCMS and DfEE published the report The Learning
Power of Museums. This set out a vision of the part museums,
galleries and other cultural bodies can play in contributing to the
learning society, and was followed by a successful Conference on
the role of museums in lifelong learning. The report recommended
that benchmarks should be developed against which museums’
performance can be measured and monitored. It also identified the
need for comprehensive research to give clear evidence of the
benefits that flow when museums contribute to learning. Resource,

which became operational on 1 April 2000, is implementing these
recommendations. It has undertaken to publish an education
strategy by March 2001. One of the key elements of this strategy
will be the development of a cross-sectoral education standard.
Cultural Heritage and Information Sector National Training
Organisations
The Department has been working closely with the Cultural
Heritage National Training Organisation (CHNTO) and the
Information Services National Training Organisation (ISNTO) to
assist both in forming partnerships with other cultural bodies and
in helping to improve the skills structure in the museums, galleries,
libraries and archives sectors. The Department has contributed
to both organisations’ publications; CHNTO’s Management
Development Strategy in the Cultural Heritage Sector, for example, was
launched at a conference in November 2000 at which Alan
Howarth gave the keynote speech. This co-operation will continue
both sectorally and through the IMPACT group of cultural sector
NTOs. Resource has, on behalf of DCMS, undertaken a review of
CHNTO and ISNTO and will be making recommendations to the
Department on future developments.
Culture Online
In September 2000, the Secretary of State announced a new
cultural initiative, provisionally entitled Culture Online, which will
form part of the Department’s Information Age Strategy, in using
the Internet (and in due course other electronic media) to enrich
the educational curriculum by providing not just access to, but also
participation in, the arts and culture. The planned development of
this initiative is outlined in Chapter 3.
Media and Broadcasting
Media Literacy
In an age of digital broadcasting and technological convergence,
and the challenge to traditional regulation these will bring, there is
a need for a more coherent approach to media literacy and critical
viewing skills. Following a successful Media Education Seminar
held in 1999, the Department has prepared a Media Literacy

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

4/3/01

19:33

Page 71

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

71

Statement. This statement sets out the Department’s understanding
of media literacy and critical viewing and acts as a point of
reference for future work.
The Moving Image in Education
The Film Education Working Group’s report, Making Movies
Matter examined the area of film education and set out a number of
proposals to bring ‘cineliteracy’ into the classroom. The Film
Council, with the help of the British Film Institute (BFI), has been
given responsibility for taking the proposals forward, in liaison
with DCMS, DfEE and the film industry. New references to the
moving image have been included in the National Curriculum and,
building on these references, the British Film Institute has
published Moving Images in the Classroom, to help teachers make
effective and imaginative use of moving images across all subjects
of the Secondary National Curriculum.
During the year, the Film Council announced its First Movies
project, a grant-funded programme supported by £1 million of
Lottery funds which will begin in 2001. First Movies will offer
children and young people the opportunity to try film-making and
display their talents. Films will be shot using the latest low-cost
technology and a showcase will be developed for the best films.
The Global Film School, an Internet-based learning network for
the screen media, was launched this year by the National Film and
Television School in partnership with University of California at
Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Theatre, Film, and Television and
the Australian Film Television and Radio School. The Global Film
School aims to be operational in 2001 and will provide courses and
programmes in four learning zones: the Media Literacy Zone,
aimed at primary and secondary level school children; the Open
Learning Zone, open to anyone who has the time, access to the
Internet and an interest in screen media; the Global Conservatory
Zone, which consists of certificated coursework on undergraduate
and graduate level, for students seriously pursuing a professional
career; and the Professional Zone, which is for registered
professionals to re-skill and keep abreast of the latest developments
in their discipline.

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

Skills Within the Broadcasting Industry
The Audio-Visual Industries Training Group (AVITG) was
established jointly by the Department and Skillset, the National
Training Organisation for Broadcasting, Film, Video and
Multimedia, in 1999. The group’s role is to investigate and report
on the current and future skills required in broadcasting and the
electronic media and to recommend the training and education
needed to develop those skills, so that the UK can compete
effectively in the world media market place. One of the key areas
of activity for the group has been to undertake a census of the
entire industry for the first time, producing a definitive picture of
the size, scope and nature of employment within it. This census
(published 24 November 2000) has provided the group with
detailed information and statistics on which to base its work and
recommendations. The group is due to report its findings in
spring 2001.
The Historic and Built Environment
Education of the public in architectural and urban design issues is
central to the remit of the Commission for Architecture and the
Built Environment (CABE) which came into being during the
year. In May 2000, DCMS appointed a Commissioner with
responsibility for developing CABE’s educational role, with
particular emphasis on working with schools, and the Department
is working with the Commission to develop its educational
strategy. The Department also arranged to have the booklet, Our
Street, reprinted to meet a high demand. The booklet was originally
published by CABE’s predecessor, the Royal Fine Art Commission
and, by taking as its subject a single street and using a range of
imaginative activities, it encourages children to think about the
built environment in their city, town or village.
On a broader front, DCMS has kept a close eye on the
recommendations emerging from English Heritage’s report Power
of Place, which was published on 14 December 2000 as the first
stage in the Historic Environment Policy Review (see section 2.4(c)
below). The Department has taken particular note of those relating
to education and training, as these chime closely with a number of
other proposals that the DCMS has been considering relating to

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

4/3/01

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

73

maximising the educational potential of the built heritage and
securing the necessary skills base to conserve the built
environment effectively. In addition, DCMS has been supporting
the Churches Conservation Trust in its efforts to develop a
strategy for making effective educational use of the 317 disused
churches under its care.
2.4 Excellence
Objective: To ensure that everyone has the opportunity to achieve
excellence in the areas of culture, media and sport and to develop talent,
innovation and good design.
Excellence is one of the Department’s four high-level aims.
We believe that excellence should be encouraged everywhere, and
that the good can be distinguished from the less good across the
whole range of cultural and recreational activity.
Excellence both aligns with and reinforces the other three overarching DCMS aims of access, education, and the promotion of
the creative industries. Access stimulates an appetite for excellence,
and education is the key to the development of the discerning
audiences of the future. The creative and leisure industries, like any
other, will not thrive without a public environment – and a market
– that fosters excellence and innovation.
Excellence does not mean exclusivity but rather making sure that
exacting standards are maintained in all fields of activity, to
enhance the quality of life for everyone.
The Department has three primary objectives that support its
general aim of excellence, and examples of some of the work
that the Department is carrying out towards each objective are
given below:
a) Increasing the pool of talent
If the wealth and variety of creativity that exists in Britain is to be
tapped, talented individuals need to be supported and given the
opportunity to develop their talent regardless of their means.

The role of UK Sport is primarily focussed on the achievement of
international success and the representation of UK sport
internationally. To achieve this, the Council’s work is geared
to supporting individuals to achieve international success and
developing and supporting a system capable of producing a
constant flow of world-class performers.
The Department has worked closely with DfEE on the
establishment of Specialist Sports Colleges. These schools place
sport at the heart of the curriculum and the life of the school.
There are already 83 such colleges across the country, where
young people can develop their sporting talent without
sacrificing their studies, and following the Prime Minister’s
announcement in September of £24 million of additional
funding, this number is expected to rise to 150 by 2004.
The Global Film School, launched this year by the National Film
and Television School in partnership with the University of
California at Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Theatre, Film and
Television and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School,
will provide opportunities for participants ranging from
schoolchildren to registered professionals to hone their talents
and skills via the Internet.
b) Developing an appetite for excellence
Raising people’s horizons creates a society – and a market – in which
excellence both has an audience and is demanded.
The winning performance of the British Teams at the Olympic
and Paralympic Games made us all proud. This was the best
showing by a British Team at the Olympics since 1920, coming
home with an outstanding haul of 28 medals. The Paralympic
Team also had a magnificent Games, with a tally of 131 medals,
finishing second in the overall table. This was achieved through
the focus, determination and talent of our athletes, harnessed and
given a chance by the Lottery funding they and their coaches
received. We have given a firm commitment that the level of
Lottery support for our best sportsmen and women will be at
least maintained and, if possible, enhanced over the next four

years. Apart from its role in developing talent, UK Sport also
seeks to attract major events to the UK in order to expand the
UK’s influence in international sport, bring economic benefits,
and develop the sport involved. As a result, the Government
has given its support in the past year to successful bids by
UK Athletics to stage the 2003 World Indoor Athletics
Championships and 2005 World Athletics Championships.
In July, the European Commission formally verified the
Government’s list of ‘Crown Jewel’ sporting events which, under
UK broadcasting legislation, must be available for live broadcast
on BBC1 and 2, the ITV network and/or Channel 4. Chris Smith
said ‘The Government’s aim has been to protect viewers’
interests without imposing disproportionate restrictions on the
commercial interests of either the events’ organisers, who hold
the rights, or broadcasters. This decision means that the public
can watch the most important sports events live on television
without having to pay a subscription fee.’
The Department has the responsibility within Government
for implementing UNESCO’s World Heritage (WH)
Convention, and in December led the UK’s delegation to the
WH Committee’s Annual Conference in Cairns, Australia. The
Department was delighted that the Committee accepted the
UK’s nomination for WH status of the Blaenavon Industrial
Landscape in South Wales and the Historic Town of St George
and Related Fortifications in Bermuda. The UK now has
20 WH Sites.
c) Ensuring that standards are met
This will mainly be achieved not through direct intervention but through
our key expert public bodies: the Arts Council of England, Sport England,
UK Sport, English Heritage, the English Tourism Council, the
Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, the Film
Council and Resource (the Museums, Archives and Libraries Council).
The quality of outputs and outcomes is not easily measured, but
DCMS is encouraging the relevant public bodies to establish
standards and consequently to attain robust performance data.

The Arts Council has put in place a number of processes to
ensure that the delivery of, and/or the opportunity to achieve,
excellence is an important consideration when decisions
regarding the distribution of funds are made. These include peer
review, panels/committees, staff expertise, funding agreements,
annual reviews and quinquennial appraisals of regularly
funded bodies. The Arts Council is also supporting and
promoting excellence through the Breakthrough programme,
through which awards totalling £1.2 million were made to
16 organisations in December. The aim is to put the spotlight
on the selected organisations whose outstanding work has
broken new ground for the arts, making it possible for them to
continue to experiment and take risks, enabling them to push
the boundaries of their work even further.
UK Sport have set their own standards in devising targets for the
proportion of athletes named in the UK World Class Performance
Programmes who are, or have been, in receipt of services
provided through the UK Sports Institute network.
The Department has worked with CABE and others to develop
and contribute to a range of initiatives aimed at improving the
quality of public sector buildings, in particular the publication of
Better Public Buildings in October 2000. This policy statement
urges a step change in the quality of building design in the
public sector.
Following a wide consultation exercise launched in May 2000 by
the Secretary of State, DCMS itself published new standards for
Public Libraries in England on 12 February 2001. DCMS will
monitor levels of performance against the standards, which will be
a feature of Annual Library Plans (ALPs) for 2001 and beyond.
The new standards are grouped under principal service level
objectives:
to locate libraries to enable convenient and suitable access for users;
to ensure that opening hours of libraries are adequate for users;
to develop information and communication technology for users;
to ensure satisfactory services for the issuing and reserving
of books;

to encourage the use made of the public library service;
to enhance user satisfaction with the services provided;
to provide choice in books and materials made available to users;
to provide appropriate levels of qualified staff.
As part of a wider commitment to the preservation of access to the
nation’s distinctive historic environment, on 18 November 1999 the
Government announced that it would undertake a review of
policies in this area providing an unprecedented opportunity to
focus on attitudes towards heritage, to stimulate national debate
about the importance of the historic environment to quality of life,
and to create an integrated approach to managing the historic
environment for the next century. Overall responsibility for this
review rests jointly with the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the
Regions, but as a first phase, the Departments commissioned
English Heritage (EH) to address a number of specific policy issues
and submit a report. In accordance with a request by Government,
EH consulted exhaustively in preparing its report, Power of Place,
which was published on 14 December 2000. Power of Place made a
range of recommendations – both immediate and longer term – to
strengthen protection of the historic environment and enhance its
contribution to contemporary life. The recommendations were for
action not only by Government, but also by the heritage sector
generally, including local authorities, regional bodies and owners.
Numerous Government Departments have an interest in the issues
raised in Power of Place, and in contributing to the Government’s
response. We will now consider with the greatest care the analysis
and the recommendations in Power of Place and aim to publish
a major policy statement on the historic environment in the
spring of 2001.
2.5 The National Lottery
Objective: To maintain public support for the National Lottery and
ensure that the objective of the Lottery Fund supports DCMS’ and other
national priorities.
The National Lottery is now more than six years old and has had
a tremendous impact on our national life, raising more than
£10 billion for good causes.

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

The Government has encouraged distributors to target areas with
low take-up of Lottery funds. Changes introduced through the 1998
Act and the revised policy directions are now beginning to benefit
areas and groups previously under-represented within the spread
of Lottery awards.
Next Licence
Camelot’s current licence as operator of the National Lottery
expires in September 2001. Following a competition, the National
Lottery Commission announced in December that Camelot had
been awarded a second seven-year licence.
New Distributor
Scottish Screen became a distributor on 7 April 2000 when it
assumed from the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) responsibility for
awarding National Lottery funds in respect of films and film
making. It receives 1.16 per cent of the arts share of Lottery
proceeds; consequently the share allocated to the SAC has fallen
from 8.9 per cent to 7.74 per cent.
New Opportunities Fund
The New Opportunities Fund (NOF) was set up in January 1999
as the sixth good cause of the National Lottery with a remit to
support projects in the fields of health, education and the
environment, with a particular focus on those at risk of social
exclusion. It has six ongoing initiatives totalling £1.5 billion, of
which NOF has so far committed over £600 million (i.e. 40 per cent):
healthy living centres – £300 million to create a network of
healthy living centres that will contribute to tackling inequalities
in health. Priority is given to projects which focus on areas of
urban and rural deprivation, and the needs of people who suffer
worse health than average;
out of school hours activities – £205 million for out of school hours
education projects and £225 million for childcare provision
across the UK;

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

ICT training – for teachers and school librarians (£230 million),
librarians (£20 million) and the digitisation of learning materials
(£50 million);
cancer prevention, detection, treatment and care – £150 million for
the purchase of new equipment and for supporting palliative care
and cancer prevention projects;
green spaces and sustainable communities – £125 million to create,
preserve, promote or improve access to urban and rural green
spaces; and to support community-based projects to engage local
people in caring for their environment and promoting
sustainable development; and
community access to lifelong learning – £200 million for the
development of a network of ICT Learning Centres linked to the
National Grid for Learning, the creation of Community Grids for
Learning, and the completion of the People’s Network, which
will link all public libraries in the UK to the Internet by 2002.
When the millennium income stream comes to an end in 2001,
NOF’s share of the money from good causes will rise to 33.3 per
cent. The rest will continue to be split equally between the arts,
charities, sport and heritage.
In November 2000, the Government launched a public consultation
on new initiatives to be funded by NOF.
In summary these proposals are:
£750 million for additional sport facilities for schools and wider
community use;
£50 million for outdoor adventure and other activities for
young people;
£300 million to boost the fight against heart disease and stroke,
provide extra money for the Fund’s existing initiative
to combat cancer, and provide palliative care for adults and
children with life-threatening and chronic illness;

999059 DCMS Section 2-2001

4/3/01

81

£200 million for the provision of childcare places for children of
0–3 years, together with further support for the over-3s,
particularly in deprived areas;
£150 million for a programme of environmental renewal and
community regeneration that would support community
regeneration, promote recycling and develop renewable energy
sources; and
an amount to be provided as small grants for community groups
to support local health, education and environment projects.
New policy directions will be issued to the Fund in the spring
of 2001.
Lottery Grants for Local Groups
Awards for All is a Lottery-funded programme to help support
local groups. It aims to fund groups which involve people in the
local community or which bring people together to enjoy arts,
charities, sports, heritage and community activities. In this
programme grants of between £500 and £5,000 will help groups
to do their work better, to involve more people or new people and
to create a lasting benefit for communities. Priority is given to
groups with an annual income of less than £15,000 The scheme
is jointly funded by Lottery distributors in England and Scotland.
It is proposed that the New Opportunities Fund will join the
programme, allowing groups to apply for funds to support local
health, education and environment projects.
Improving Geographical Distribution of Funds
The Department and the Lottery distributors jointly commissioned
research from Sheffield Hallam University to examine the impact
of the National Lottery on the coalfields and other areas that have
fared badly in terms of receiving Lottery funding. The first phase
of the research confirmed that coalfields areas were doing badly,
but showed that the distribution pattern varied among the
distributors. The second phase of their report, published in June
2000, made recommendations to ensure that every community
receives its fair share of Lottery funding.

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

An action group, involving officials from DCMS, the devolved
administrations, Lottery distributors and other agencies, has been
set up to take forward the recommendations in the report. Issues
considered include the active encouragement of applications from
low take-up areas; reducing partnership funding requirements in
areas of low take-up; making decision-making more transparent so
it is easier to learn from unsuccessful applications; and closer
working with other funders at regional and local level.
Simplifying Application Processes
The Quality, Efficiency and Standards Team (QUEST) published
Phase 1 of its Review of Lottery Application Processes in August
2000. The report looked at applications for grants of up to
£100,000 and included recommendations for improving
application and assessment procedures to help ease the
administrative burden for small organisations and community
groups applying for funding. Distributors have welcomed the
report and are taking forward its recommendations. These include:
the setting up of a joint distributor national helpline to provide
initial advice and guidance for potential applicants; reducing
information requirements on applications for smaller grants; and
ensuring that all guidance notes for applicants are of high standard.
Evaluation
The Government is undertaking a project to evaluate the impact,
in social and economic terms, of Lottery funding for the good
causes. The Department has now agreed common performance
indicators with distributors for use in future evaluation and
monitoring forms. For evaluating the qualitative impact of the
Lottery, DCMS has formulated a specification for external
consultants to undertake the next stage of the project. This will
involve formulating a set of questions designed to elicit qualitative
information about the experience of using Lottery-funded projects.
This new approach will be tested by the consultants in a number of
case studies of specific localities and the findings will be collated
for a report on the impact of Lottery spending to be published by
DCMS in due course.

2.6 Regeneration and social inclusion
Objective: To promote the role of the Department’s sectors in urban and
rural regeneration, in pursuing sustainability and in combatting social
exclusion.
Whilst a single definition of social exclusion can be elusive and its
measurement problematic, it has been described as ‘what can
happen when people or areas suffer from a combination of linked
problems such as unemployment, poor skills, low incomes, poor
housing, high crime environments, bad health, poverty and family
breakdown.’ From this notion five Government objectives for social
inclusion have been derived: improved educational achievement,
increased employment prospects, improved health, reduced crime,
and improved physical environment. This is the definition of social
inclusion that underlies DCMS policies.
As part of the Government’s neighbourhood renewal strategy,
DCMS chaired the Social Exclusion Unit’s Policy Action Team on
arts and sport (PAT 10), which reported on the real contribution
that these sectors can make to neighbourhood renewal. Since
PAT 10 the Department has developed social inclusion action
plans for its various policy areas, with the aim of securing real
improvements in the quality of life in deprived neighbourhoods and
among potentially excluded groups. A progress report, Building on
PAT 10, was published in February 2001.
Working in partnership is a key aspect of delivering social
inclusion throughout the Department’s sectors. The progress
report covers such partnerships with local communities,
government departments, the wider public sector and business.
The Department continues to discuss with the National Lottery
distributors how best to co-ordinate and evaluate strategies to
combat social exclusion. It is encouraging local authorities to
include social inclusion objectives in their local cultural strategies
and will ensure that the Government Offices and Regional
Development Agencies involve culture, leisure and tourism
organisations in plans for regeneration. Tourism interests are also
being pursued through contact with the industry.

DCMS Objectives – Achievements 2000–01

PAT10 identified ethnic minority communities and people with
disabilities as at particular risk of social exclusion, irrespective of
where they live, and DCMS will seek to promote the inclusion
of these groups through their increased participation in culture
and leisure.
The Department has been aided considerably in the
implementation of the PAT10 report by an advisory group of
leading representatives of all our key partners. The group met for
the final time in October 2000, at the stage when it became clear
that social inclusion was being successfully mainstreamed in all our
sectors. There will undoubtedly remain a need to be able to gather
advice and feedback from experts in the field and from community
groups. Much of this will continue through established networks
within sectors. The Department will keep under review the need
for any overarching arrangements for consulting its partners,
especially when this could add significantly to the development or
evaluation of social inclusion policy.
To improve knowledge of the impact of culture and leisure on
social exclusion and to assist communities in monitoring and
evaluating their projects and programmes, DCMS has
commissioned its own research, as well as participating in research
being carried out in other departments. The DCMS research
programme aims to complement and co-ordinate the work of
others in the DCMS field, including NDPBs and local authorities,
and to disseminate information on ‘what works’ in combatting
social inclusion as well as on best practice in evaluation.
The Report of Policy Action Team 10 may be read on the
Department’s web site, along with some specific examples of social
inclusion projects and programmes from DCMS sectors across the
country. Other examples of work that the Department has done
towards social inclusion and regeneration are set out below.
DCMS has contributed to the Government’s Urban and Rural
White Papers published in November 2000. These papers
emphasise the role good design can play in bringing about
regeneration of areas and stress that good design brings with it a
host of social and economic benefits.

The role of the historic environment as a catalyst for urban
renewal is fully acknowledged in the Government’s White Paper
Our towns and cities: the future and is being further explored as a
key element of the Department’s Historic Environment Policy
Review.
In January 2001, Beacon Council local authorities were
announced, recognizing good practice in regeneration through
culture, sport and tourism.
From 1 November 2000, people aged 75 or over will receive free
television licences. Half-price television licences were introduced
from 1 April 2000. New targets were also set for subtitling for
the new BBC digital services. The Department believes that
public service broadcasting should reflect the different cultural
traditions in society, regional strengths and diversity and should
reflect both mainstream and minority tastes.
The Department is actively engaged with the Wembley Task
Force in trying to assist the regeneration of the area
surrounding the proposed new stadium.
The Department is also actively engaged with the local council
and agencies involved with the new Lee Valley athletics stadium
in helping the stadium act as a force for regeneration for the
surrounding area and in ensuring that a purpose-built venue can
be created for the World Athletics Championships in 2005.
Sport England have announced the launch of 12 Sport Action
Zones, with the possibility of a further 18. They are Lotteryfunded and aimed at improving sports provision in deprived
areas. Zone managers have been appointed in most of the areas
and they will be working with all the relevant local interest
groups to identify the key priorities for their areas.

Spending Review 2000 – Plans for 2001–02 to 2003–04

Spending Review 2000 allowed the Department to refocus its objectives and targets,
and stimulated a range of new initiatives, which are set out here.
3.1 The Settlement
The outcome of Spending Review 2000 enabled Chris Smith to
announce in July a very substantial increase in Departmental
funding, from £1,015 million in 2000–01 to £1,240 million in
2003–04. This includes the best-ever settlements for sport and the
arts, with sport funding almost doubling during the period and arts
funding increasing by £100 million.
Some of the key outcomes of the settlement are as follows:
a doubling of the investment in the school sport co-ordinator
programme;
£10.5 million support for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in
Manchester;
more support for regional theatres;
the establishment of 16 creative partnerships to help young
people develop artistic and creative skills;
the restoration of the Public Lending Right to its original realterms level;
a £10 million funding package for regional museum, library and
archive collections;
substantial uplifts for the Royal Parks, British Film and the
English Tourism Council;
£90 million of capital credits for local authority projects funded
under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI).
3.2 The Department’s new Public Service Agreement (PSA)
The Department’s 2001–04 PSA, published in July, sets out what
the Department and its sponsored bodies will deliver with the
resources allocated as a result of the Spending Review:

Raise significantly, year on year, the average time spent on sport
and physical activity by those aged 5 to 16.
Increase the numbers of children attending museums and
galleries by a third by 2004.
Increase by 500,000 by 2004 the numbers of people experiencing
the arts.

3.4 Some key initiatives in the new funding period
Culture Online
Announced in September 2000 by Chris Smith, Culture Online will
provide interactive participation in the arts and culture through the
Internet. It will systematically analyse the needs of its audiences –
particularly in relation to the National Curriculum – and match the
resources of the arts and cultural sector to them.
HM Treasury made available up to £5 million from the reserve
to support the developmental stage of the initiative and the
Department conducted a wide-ranging consultation exercise to
refine its vision of what Culture Online should offer. The Culture
and Recreation Bill introduced to Parliament in December 2000
contains provision to establish Culture Online as a statutory
corporation.
Communications White Paper
The consultation period for the joint DTI/DCMS White Paper,
A New Future for Communication, published in December 2000,
ended on 12 February 2001.
The new legislation needed to implement the proposals will now be
drawn up with the intention of introducing it into Parliament as
soon as a suitable legislative slot is made available. The existing
regulators will be fully involved in implementing the proposals and
ensuring the smooth transition to the new regulatory regime.
A Strategy for Sport
The Department published its strategy for sport, A Sporting Future
for All, in April 2000. The strategy identified a number of sources
of funding and initiatives that would help deliver the vision for
sport that it described. Following a successful Spending Review
settlement for sport, the Department was able to improve
significantly the resources available for some of these initiatives.
Spending on sport will have doubled by 2003–04, when it reaches
£102 million.
Schools are the key to increasing participation and improving
Britain’s performance in international sport in the medium term.

Spending Review 2000 – Plans for 2001–02 to 2003–04

People are more likely to develop a lifelong commitment to
sporting activities if they have enjoyed them while at school.
As well as helping to lay the foundations for our future sporting
success and the obvious health improvements, there are many other
benefits to participating in sport: improvements in self-esteem,
discipline, team-working skills, responsibility and creativity are just
a few. The new DCMS PSA target of increasing participation in
sport and physical activity among 5–16 year olds year on year will
be carefully monitored by the Department. In January, following
discussions between the Department and the DfEE, the Secretary
of State announced that pupils would be offered an entitlement of
at least two hours high quality PE and sport within and beyond
the timetabled curriculum. The Department will be involved in
monitoring progress towards that goal.
With this in mind, DCMS is committing £60 million to the School
Sport Co-ordinators initiative. This aims to create a network of Coordinators in secondary schools across the country, allied to sports
colleges and working closely with feeder primary schools, to offer
enhanced physical education and competitive sport in areas of
social and economic deprivation. The new funding will take the
total invested in the initiative to £120 million and will mean that
1,000 Co-ordinators will be created in around 250 ‘families’ of
schools. Around 5,000 primary schools will also benefit.
In addition, the Government has proposed that £750 million of the
New Opportunities Fund National Lottery revenue should be
committed to bringing about a step change in the quality and
availability of school sport facilities and investing in other sportbased youth projects. The initiative will focus primarily on
refurbishing existing, and building new, indoor and outdoor sports
facilities at primary and secondary schools in areas where sporting
provision is weak. The types of facility we envisage being funded
are playing fields, swimming pools, tennis courts, indoor nets and
astroturf pitches, which will be for community use as well as school
use. Outdoor adventure facilities used by schools will also benefit
from this funding by up to £50 million. As with other New
Opportunities Fund initiatives, it is proposed that priority should
be given to areas of urban and rural deprivation.

The Spending Review settlement has also enabled us to invest
£7 million in modernising National Governing Bodies. The
strategy includes a commitment to devolve more responsibility to
sport’s governing bodies, in return for improved administrative
systems and structures, a commitment to invest a percentage
of broadcasting right receipts in grass roots sport, and the
involvement of elite performers in school and community projects.
The Government is increasing its commitment to the UK Sports
Institute with an injection of a further £12 million over three
years. This will fund the cost of the Institute’s central services.
The Strategy recognises the key role that volunteers play in sport
and the need to recruit, reward and retain volunteers effectively
for sport’s long term benefit. The Department has committed
£4 million over two years to enable existing volunteering and
leadership programmes, which are based in schools, to engage
more young people and to improve the training and support offered
to them. With £3 million over the same period from the Active
Community Fund, we hope to create volunteering opportunities –
as coaches, trainers, officials, administrators or mentors – for
60,000 people.

*HMCI’s Annual Report 1996/7 (TSO,

February 1998), paragraph 72

Space for Sport and Arts
In 1998, an OfSTED report described the accommodation of one in
eight primary schools as being inadequate in some respects.
The ‘lack of sufficient outdoor or indoor accommodation for the
teaching of physical education’ and the ‘lack of access to running
water ... particularly affecting the teaching of art’ were two aspects
particularly highlighted by the report.* Following a successful joint
DCMS/DfEE bid to the Capital Modernisation Fund (CMF), Chris
Smith announced in April 2000 that the Space for Sport and Arts
(SSA) scheme would make available up to £150 million of funding
to provide around 300 new sports and arts facilities for primary
schools in the areas where they were most needed.
Building on this identified need, the SSA scheme’s objectives are to
raise educational standards, promote inclusion, and build
community pride in deprived rural and urban areas. It is an

innovative partnership between traditional public spending from
the CMF and three National Lottery distributors (Sport England,
Arts Council of England and the New Opportunities Fund) to
realise a scheme for school and community use that would not have
been funded individually by any single body. In developing the
initiative, the Department has particularly sought to break down
the barriers that have traditionally prevented such schemes coming
forward. Arts and sports facilities will feature in most schemes,
with the aim of meeting local needs and aspirations.
The Department has worked very closely with DfEE and Lottery
partners to ensure the SSA scheme targets areas of multiple
deprivation already identified as priorities for the purposes of other
programmes. A total of 65 local educational authorities (LEAs)
were invited to bid for a notional allocation and submitted outline
proposals for a total of 493 schools in December 2000. These were
considered by a joint Project Board consisting of DCMS, DfEE,
ACE, Sport England and the New Opportunities Fund (NOF).
Around 300 projects have been invited to develop detailed bids to
be submitted no later than 31 October 2001. A full evaluation of
the bids will be made and firm commitments given to LEAs before
March 2002 to enable projects to be delivered on the ground over
the summer of 2002.
Creative Partnerships
The Spending Review increased funding for the arts by
£100 million between 2000–01 and 2003–04, and Chris Smith
announced that £40 million of this funding would be allocated
over two years (starting in April 2002) to pilot 16 Creative
Partnerships to provide exciting, challenging opportunities for
young people to experience, learn from and enjoy artistic and
creative activities. Creative Partnerships, which will be run by
the Arts Council, will focus on bringing together schools, arts
and other creative organisations and the commercial creative
industries to provide enhanced opportunities for every schoolchild
in the 16 Partnership areas. Through these pilot Partnerships,
targeted on areas of deprivation, young people will be able to
access an enhanced range of activities, events and opportunities
across the creative sector, including museums, galleries, creative

industries, new media and community arts as well as mainstream
arts provision. The pilot locations range from inner city
Manchester, to areas of rural isolation, like Cornwall, and counties
with deprived coastal areas, like Norfolk.
Resource’s regional programme
Resource, the new strategic body for museums, archives and
libraries (which became fully operational on 1 April 2000) will
receive additional funding in 2002–03 and 2003–04 for investment
in, and on behalf of, museums, galleries, libraries and archives in
the English regions. In addition to the core funding programmes
inherited from the Museums and Galleries Commission and the
Library and Information Commission, Resource will have a new
regional programme of £10 million per annum. This programme
will comprise the following elements:
the continuation and development of the Designated Museums
Challenge Fund. Resource is conducting a review of the impact
of the Challenge Fund and is considering the options for the
future direction of the scheme;
an Innovation Fund to encourage new approaches to service
delivery by regional museums, archives and libraries;
new sources of advice and support to museums, archives and
libraries in relation to bidding for funds from the Lottery,
Europe and private and charitable sources; and
incentive funding to strengthen existing regional structures and
to encourage cross-sectoral working between Area Museums
Councils, Regional Archives Councils and Regional Library
Systems.
Resource are also – at the Secretary of State’s request – leading a
review of the position and needs of regional museums across the
country and the relationship between regional and national
institutions.

European Capital of Culture
In 2008 the UK will host the European Capital of Culture.
The city that wins the title will put on a year-long festival. The
competition to select the city was launched in September 2000
when the criteria were published (www.culture.gov.uk/creative).
Bids must be submitted by 31 March 2002 and the winning city
will be nominated by the Prime Minister. The other short-listed
cities will be publicised and commended as Centres of Culture.
3.5 Sectoral initiatives
In addition to these headline projects, the Department will
continue to work towards the general aims and objectives set out
in its PSA in all its sectors:
Industry sponsorship
Tourism
As well as giving overall direction to the work of the two public
bodies which support UK and English tourism, DCMS will be
directly engaged in:
developing the Government’s joined-up action in support of
tourism through the Tourism Summit and the Tourism Forum;
sharpening up the aims and objectives for improved
competitiveness in the tourism industry, greater responsiveness
to changing consumer demand, and better training and use of
the people who work in the industry;
ensuring the Government pursues to a successful conclusion the
reviews of regulation now progressing and summarised in our
response to the Better Regulation Task Force;
implementing a strategy for the future of our traditional resorts,
building on the work of the English Tourism Council’s Resorts
Task Force and bringing together the public agencies behind it;
maintaining and developing the partnerships between public and
private sectors to build a world class electronic delivery system
for tourism information and tourism sales in the UK; and

building on the foundation year of the Heritage/Tourism Cluster
Group, which will aim to develop better networking and sharing
of knowledge amongst other partners in the UK with overseas
experience.
Media
Key tasks will be:
to work with the Film Council on the implementation of its
comprehensive strategy for the film industry and film culture; and
to take forward work arising out of the research into small music
companies’ access to finance.
Broadcasting
The review of the Television Without Frontiers Directive,
89/552/EEC, begins with several studies in 2001, on which the
European Commission will report throughout the year, and which
will be subject to workshops and discussions with industry and
Member States. Before the end of 2002 the Commission will
communicate its proposals for amendments to the Directive and
negotiations will begin in the relevant Council Working Group.
Our work on digital switchover is part of a vast project aiming to
give to all British citizens the best of digitisation and of new
technologies. As part of that strategy, DCMS will, jointly with the
DTI and the ITC:
launch a series of digital TV pilot projects in 2001, which will
feed into a spectrum planning strategy to ensure the most
efficient use of spectrum together with the best services and
minimal disruption for people;
monitor digital take-up and undertake research aimed at
understanding the needs and expectations of the viewers and
listeners; and

999059 DCMS Section 3-2001

bring together key public and private sector stakeholders to
develop a more comprehensive digital TV action plan, by
working with manufacturers and retailers to ensure that
everyone gets better information about digital TV services and
equipment, with broadcasters to promote the advantages of
digital TV, and with consumers (through the Viewers’ Panel) to
make sure that their interests are fully taken into account.
The Creative Industries
The emphasis in all the work of the Creative Industries Unit
towards the end of this year will be to turn all its existing analysis
into action and to ensure that the recommendations from the
reviews listed in Chapter 2 are given effect.
At its June meeting, the Creative Industries Task Force agreed a
number of initiatives:
a new work programme that will focus on strengthening our
efforts in fields such as finance, business support mechanisms
and regulation;
an updating of the 1998 Mapping Document, providing more
recent data on the contribution the creative industries make to
the economy and the issues they face. This new version will also
cover the impact of ICT, the Internet and convergence on
creative businesses, and will include a regional dimension;
a change of format. In future, there will be a Ministerial Creative
Industries Strategy Group (MCISG), whose role will be to drive
forward changes beneficial to the creative industries. In addition,
there will be informal meetings between MCISG Ministers and
leading figures in the creative industries, to allow a forum for the
discussion of current strategic issues.
The Arts
In May 2000, Peter Boyden submitted to the Arts Council his
report into the difficulties facing regional theatre. The
Government warmly welcomed the report, which provided a good

foundation for the Arts Council to refine a national policy based on
the wider theatre ecology, The Next Stage. The Arts Council sought
an additional £25 million a year to implement its new policy, and
the Department provided it, within the additional money for the
arts announced in July. The increase will be phased in over two
years with £12 million in 2002–03 and £25 million in 2003– 04.
The strategy and allocations for funding theatre in England in
2002–03 and 2003– 04 were announced in March.
The Department is continuing to develop relationships with the
key representative bodies in the industry, to represent better the
industry’s interests on a range of issues from Internet ticketing to
child performance regulation. In particular, it is committed to
maintaining a close liaison with the Society of London Theatre
(SOLT) and the Theatrical Management Association (TMA) to
explore further a number of the issues emanating from the
Wyndham and After Wyndham reports on West End Theatre.
The Department is also supporting the joint SOLT, TMA and
Independent Theatre Council Conference in 2001 that will take
many of these issues forward.
The Department will ensure that the industry’s interests are
represented within Government by pursuing dialogue with other
departments on a range of issues, the aim being to support better
regulation in areas that have an impact on economic and artistic
growth. Examples include the Financial Services and Marketing
Act, the Liquor Licensing White Paper, child actors legislation, and
discussions about withholding tax within Europe.
Education
In addition to the new educational initiatives described in section
3.4 above:
Through the People’s Network programme, all 4,300 public
libraries in the UK will be online and linked to the National Grid
for Learning by the end of 2002. Online public libraries form an
integral part of the Government’s wider UK online programme,
which aims to give Internet access to everybody in the UK who
wants it by 2005.

The DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge Fund’s Reader
Development and British History Programmes will be repeated
in 2001–02. An evaluation study of the reader development
projects funded this year will be completed and disseminated.
The Government has undertaken to respond by March 2001 to
the recommendations in the report Empowering the Learning
Community, regarding the co-ordination of library resources in
support of lifelong learning. A conference on this subject will be
held in London on 28 March 2001.
The National Lottery
Key tasks for 2001–04 are:
to increase public awareness of the Lottery opportunities,
particularly in areas of social exclusion;
to continue to build on the work already done with distributors
to achieve a fairer geographical spread of Lottery funds and to
make the application process more accessible;
to work with the New Opportunities Fund and other
departments to ensure that the third round of NOF initiatives is
delivered effectively; and
to evaluate the achievements of the Lottery so far and to establish
consistent baselines for ongoing evaluation for future years.
Young People and Social Inclusion
The Department has been working with partners across
Government and beyond to ensure a better future for young
people, especially those at risk of social exclusion. Spending Review
2000 unlocked a considerable range of funds for young people,
most notably the new Children’s Fund, which will be focused
primarily on delivering better preventive services and new
community solutions for 5–13 year olds showing early warning
signs of exclusion and disaffection. The Fund, announced in
Spending Review 2000, will roll out gradually from 2001, covering

the whole of England by 2004. As with the Sure Start scheme,
money from the Children’s Fund will be controlled at a local level.
The Department has been working to ensure that the Fund
releases the potential that sport and culture have to improve the
life chances of children at risk – through building self-esteem
and respect for others, promoting self-discipline and fostering
social skills.
The Department has also played a considerable role in the
development of the new Connexions Card for 16–19 year olds and
Connexions Service for 13–19 year olds. It has helped foster links
between practitioners in our fields and the policymakers in charge
of the projects, again helping to ensure that the benefits of culture
and sport are spread to all.
In January the Secretary of State announced that DCMS and DfEE
will jointly commission two pilot studies to test the feasibility of
offering unemployed people on New Deal programmes
opportunities to work and train as sports assistants alongside
School Sport Co-ordinators. The scheme will harness the power of
sport to motivate disadvantaged and disaffected young people and
allow them to build experience and qualifications in a range of
skills with wider applications in the world of work. The pilot
studies will begin in April, and if they are successful over the next
year, the initiative will be extended across the country by 2004.
After the Millennium
The Department’s Millennium Unit is committed to providing a
full range of support to Ministers and continues to liaise closely
with the Millennium Commission, the New Millennium Experience
Company (NMEC) and a range of public and private sector
organisations in a bid to secure the best deal to deliver long term
regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula and continued benefits for
the local community. The Millennium Commission has also set the
challenge for an organisation to take over the Millennium Awards
Scheme, and the successful organisation will be responsible for
administering a £100 million Endowment Fund. An estimated

£5–6 million is expected to be distributed in Awards each year and
the Endowment Fund will represent the legacy of the investment
made in people for the millennium as well as ensuring the longterm future of the Scheme.

4.6 Training and development
The Department has continued to offer a wide range of training
and development opportunities designed to meet both DCMS and
personal development objectives. A full induction programme
has been maintained for new staff, and the DCMS management
training programme has been extended. A core training
programme has been introduced, covering topics such as serving
Ministers, effective administrative support, and effective
sponsorship of non-departmental public bodies. Other training
events included effective management of sensitive issues; coaching
skills; presentational skills; and creative thinking and innovative
action. A mentoring programme is also due to come on stream
from the beginning of 2001.
4.7 Investors in People
The Department was recognised as an Investor in People (IiP) in
October 1999, two months ahead of schedule. Re-accreditation took
place in February 2001. The Department has continued to do the
good things for which it was awarded IiP and acted on the helpful
recommendations made by the assessor. For example, in the area of
communication, the Department has set up a regular programme
for individual divisions to present an overview of their work to the
Management Board, introduced a policy on shadowing, enhanced
social activities and revamped its induction training. DCMS
continues to operate in a way that recognises the importance of its

4.9 Better management
The Department continues to strive for excellence in its
management practice and has recently introduced a new work
experience policy that encourages those from ethnic minorities and
those with disabilities to gain an insight into the workings of
DCMS, a shadowing scheme to help staff in their personal
development and a secondment policy to help staff in their personal
development, and allow those outside the Department to bring new
ideas to DCMS. A full Departmental meeting is held on a regular
basis, with Ministers and Management Board, to debate Better
Management issues, and an action plan has been developed to
capture recommendations from the staff opinion survey, the
conferences held on creating a modern DCMS staff and the Peer
Review of the Department.

Departmental Management, Resources and Expenditure

4.10 Investment and asset management
The Departmental Investment Strategy (DIS), published separately
as an outcome of the 2000 Spending Review, describes the
Department’s strategic plans both for new investment and for the
use of existing assets. A copy can be viewed on the Internet site
www.culture.gov.uk
Strategic Policy Context
The Department has put in place three-year funding agreements
with its sponsored bodies that link Government investment to
outcomes which reflect our central themes of access, excellence,
education and the development of the creative industries. These
agreements are designed both to set challenging targets for the
individual organisations and to ensure that the Department can
meet its PSA targets. They also provide clear benefits in terms of
stability of funding and long-term planning.
Capital Allocation
The Department’s Capital Budget within its Departmental
Expenditure Limit is as follows:

Asset Utilisation
The Department has direct ownership of a limited number of
assets. The bodies outside the boundary, for which the Department
has policy responsibility, own and manage a wide range of assets,
including heritage assets and inalienable assets, which are intended
to be preserved in trust for future generations because of their
cultural, environmental or historical associations. These heritage
assets include historic buildings, archaeological sites, museums and
galleries collections, archives, burial mounds, ruins, monuments
and statues.
The Department remains committed to increasing efficiency
through better utilisation of public assets, and encourages all its
non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) and the Royal Parks
Agency to consider the opportunities for commercial exploitation
of assets, goods and services where it is sensible to do so. The
Quality, Efficiency and Standards Team (QUEST) will also play a
role in advising DCMS and its NDPBs on the development of
strategies for the commercial exploitation of assets.
Asset Disposal
The Department’s asset disposals were outlined in the reporting
against PSA objectives in Chapter 1.
Public Private Partnerships
The Department and its sponsored bodies are alive to the
opportunities provided by the Private Finance Initiative, in
particular its scope for providing better managed procurement and
for transferring to the private sector those risks that the public
sector does not have the expertise to manage so successfully.
Sponsored bodies are encouraged to identify opportunities and
implement projects.
Projects agreed to date, with a total value of £6.6 million, include;
the British Library Catering project, for the provision of catering
services, including equipping of the catering facilities;
the British Library Corporate Bibliography Programme, for the

provision of an integrated bibliographic service for the British
Library; and
the restoration and catering facilities at Pembroke Lodge, by the
Royal Parks Agency.
Procedures and systems
Building on the work necessary to produce the DIS, the
Department plans, during 2000, to prepare a Departmental Asset
Management Plan setting out the extent, condition, utilisation and
suitability of its asset base and its forward plans for capital works,
including asset disposals. The aim of this plan is to ensure efficient
and effective management of its assets, and to maximise value
for money. The Department also plans to explore the scope for
introducing asset management planning in sponsored bodies.
4.11 Capital Modernisation Fund
In addition to the Department’s Capital Budget, £75 million has
been allocated from the Capital Modernisation Fund (£15 million
in 2000–01 and £60 million in 2001–02) for the Space for Sport
and Arts Scheme. More information on the scheme is given in
Chapter 3.
4.12 Sponsorship
The Department has an official responsible for ensuring that
relevant guidance on commercial sponsorship is known and
adhered to throughout the Department. DCMS is currently
considering its own approach on sponsorship which will be
consistent with the guidance and with best practice.
4.13 Sustainable development
As the Department’s Green Minister, Janet Anderson is
responsible for championing sustainable development within
Departmental policy formulation, so that this reflects sustainable
economic growth, social progress and environmental protection,
and for spearheading efforts within the Department and its
sponsored bodies to ensure that our business activities are
sustainable. The senior official to contact in this area is Paul Bolt
(tel: 020 7211 6278).

999059 DCMS Section 4-2001

Sustainable development has been defined as handing on the same
or greater stock of capital to each succeeding generation, that is
economic capital, environmental capital and social capital. Within
DCMS, the immediately relevant areas are as follows:
close collaboration on Sustainable Tourism with the DETR. The
English Tourism Council is now spearheading the development
of the ‘wise growth’ of tourism in England;
the Department’s work with English Heritage to achieve
sustainable conservation-led regeneration and the use of the built
environment to support social, physical and economic
regeneration;
the development of projects through the National Lottery,
including the Heritage Lottery Fund’s work on urban parks and
on local heritage, and the New Opportunities Fund’s Green
Spaces and Sustainable Communities initiative;
the Royal Parks Agency’s work on parks and open spaces;
work on natural history and biodiversity, led by the Natural
History Museum;
the ‘green housekeeping’ practised within the Department; and
the contribution that DCMS social inclusion initiatives
specifically, and participation in cultural and leisure activity in
general make towards the building and maintenance of social
capital, through the realisation of the broad governmental
objectives of improvements to health, educational achievement,
employment, housing and crime reduction.
The Department has a further important role in realising the aims
of sustainable development through the development and definition
of the idea of cultural capital, that of sustaining cultural and
creative participation and output. Although there are definitional
and measurement challenges here, these are not insurmountable.
At the local level there is the possibility of developing a ‘local

cultural index’ that would measure the vitality of communities and
DCMS is working to do so alongside the Arts Council, its advisers
and pioneering local authorities.
In terms of ‘greening’ our own operations, DCMS plans to
implement environmental management systems by June 2001.
4.14 Quinquennial reviews
The Department is committed to ensuring that its sponsored
bodies and the Royal Parks Agency undergo quinquennial reviews.
A rolling programme of reviews, subject to annual revision, is
being implemented.
The full programme as at April 2001 is:
Reviews continuing into 2001–02

4.15 Internal audit
The Department’s Internal Audit Unit gives assurance to the
Accounting Officer on DCMS’ internal control system and assists
managers in the Department by advising on the adequacy of the
controls for which they are responsible and by recommending
improvements.
Key issues in the audit strategy for 2000 and beyond are the
further development of corporate governance; supporting the

999059 DCMS Section 4-2001

118

4/3/01

19:59

Page 118

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Departmental Management, Resources and Expenditure

Department’s risk management systems; formulating a strategy for
providing an audit assurance on controls over the achievement of
Departmental objectives; and other work to support the
Accounting Officer’s statement on internal financial control.
The Unit also supports and promotes internal audit in the
Department’s NDPBs and monitors its adequacy and effectiveness.
Key achievements in 2000–01 include an annual review of
corporate governance in DCMS and the completion of a series of
audits of cross-cutting sponsorship subjects, including framework
documents and National Lottery Distribution. In 1999– 2000 the
Unit completed 53 audits and made 270 accepted recommendations
for improvements in controls.
4.16 Bill payment
The Department has signed up to the British Standard for
Achieving Good Payment Performance in Commercial
Transactions (BS 7890) and is committed to the payment of all
invoices not in dispute in accordance with agreed contractual
conditions or, where no such conditions exist, within 30 days of
receipt of goods or services or the presentation of a valid invoice.
Monitoring of DCMS payment performance as at the end of
December 2000 showed that 99.0 per cent of invoices were settled
within this timescale. This compares with a performance of
99.6 per cent in 1999–2000 and 97.8 per cent in 1998–99.
4.17 Facilities management
The management of facilities services within DCMS was outsourced to WSP Facilities Management in October 1999. As part
of the five-year contract, a 24-hour help desk service is provided,
based at the contractor’s offices. In April 2000, the phased
implementation of the project was completed, and all service
provision is now the contractual responsibility of WSP.
4.18 Economic appraisal
Before DCMS-sponsored bodies can proceed with major spending
decisions, an economic appraisal of the project is required. This
appraisal needs to demonstrate that, of the options available, the

999059 DCMS Section 4-2001

Page 119

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

119

preferred project represents the best value for money that can be
obtained. The same rigorous appraisal is required of the bids
submitted to the Lottery Distribution Boards by sponsored bodies.
In March 2000 DCMS Economics Branch issued an updated
version of ‘The White Book’ of customised guidance on economic
appraisal for DCMS and its sponsored bodies.
Economics Branch is the focus for both internal and externally
funded economic and evaluation research, as well as for the
technical input for Regulatory Impact Assessments which
accompany regulatory proposals. Internal research covers a wide
range of policy issues including the economic aspects of the
National Lottery. On the wider research front, Economics Branch
provides technical input to a range of academic research projects
and programmes (for example, the major study co-ordinated by the
Policy Studies Institute entitled ‘The Cultural Sector in the UK:
Profile and Policy Issues’, due to be completed early in 2001). The
Branch also participates in research seminar groups and networks
funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and a range
of other sponsors.
4.19 Statistics and research
The Department currently publishes no statistics under the
Government Statistical Service logo because it is primarily a user
of a wide range of official statistics on the creative industries,
cultural activities and tourism. The Department is also one of the
sponsors of a number of surveys run by the Office for National
Statistics (for example the International Passenger Survey and the
UK Time Use Survey). DCMS therefore had no National Statistics
of its own when the Government’s Framework for National
Statistics was launched in June 2000. Its first set of National
Statistics is due to be released in April 2001, reporting on National
Lottery awards by area. The Department is also working with the
national tourist boards to develop National Statistics on the
activity of UK residents in the tourism industry and on occupancy
rates in hotels and similar accommodation.
The Department conducted internal reviews during the year on
statistical and social policy research needs and on economic

999059 DCMS Section 4-2001

research and evaluation, as part of the modernising government
agenda. Main recommendations included:
strategic research and statistics programmes within DCMS and
within individual non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs),
driven by policy needs (including the evaluation of policy) and
fully integrated with the business planning round
an information base of quality assured statistics and research,
available as a common resource for DCMS and NDPBs, from
which National Statistics and other publicly available material
would also be drawn; and
better information management within DCMS and individual
NDPBs, to identify information needs and to make best use of
the information available.
The many detailed recommendations are now being implemented
within the available resources, and a new research network has
been formed, linking DCMS and research managers in NDPBs, to
offer support for this programme.
4.20 Public Accounts Committee Recommendations
The Department is awaiting a report from the Public Accounts
Committee (PAC), following the appearance before them on 15
November of the Permanent Secretary, Robin Young, Mike
O’Connor (Director, Millennium Commission) and David James
(Executive Chairman, New Millennium Experience Company).
This followed on from the 9 November report by the Comptroller
and Auditor General The Millennium Dome (HC 936).
Following publication of the National Audit Office (NAO) report
Grants made by the National Lottery Charities Board on 6 April 2000,
a related hearing took place before the PAC on 10 May 2000. The
PAC published its report in February 2001, and DCMS will
respond to the report’s recommendations by late April 2001. A full
account of the PAC report’s recommendations will appear in the
DCMS Annual Report 2002.

On 30 March 2000, the Government published its response to the
PAC report on the Arts Council of England: Monitoring major capital
projects funded by the National Lottery. The PAC report followed an
investigation by the NAO into the project management of 15 of the
largest capital awards over £5 million made by the Arts Council
from 1995 to 1997. Overall, the NAO report was supportive of the
approach taken by the Arts Council towards some of the biggest
and most complex capital projects. All these projects received their
awards before the introduction of the Arts Council’s Three Stage
Process, which is designed to minimise technical uncertainty early
on in projects.
The report contained a number of recommendations on how
monitoring could and should be improved for such projects. By the
date of the PAC hearing (21 June 1999) the majority of the
recommendations made in the original NAO report had already
been implemented or were in the process of being implemented.
The principal areas of recommendation were:
that it is essential that the Arts Council has appropriate financial
and management expertise; the Committee note that the Arts
Council have established a Finance and Business Service Unit,
but consider that this should have happened sooner;
that the Arts Council should monitor and evaluate the
effectiveness of the new assessment and management of
applications and awards. The PAC look to DCMS to ensure that
this is done;
that the Arts Council must adopt a robust approach to enforcing
special terms and conditions;
that in noting the Department does not second-guess Arts
Council decisions, the PAC look to DCMS to ensure that lessons
learned are shared with other distributors. The PAC welcomed
DCMS assurance that the Department’s role is to share best
practice with distributors.
The Department and the Arts Council accepted all of these
recommendations.

4.21 Quality, Efﬁciency and Standards Team
Following the Comprehensive Spending Review, the Quality
Efficiency and Standards Team (QUEST) was set up to identify,
evaluate and promote good practice in the achievement of outputs
directed towards Departmental objectives across DCMS funded
bodies and the cultural industries, and to provide independent
advice to the Secretary of State on the performance of funded
bodies in meeting Departmental objectives.
QUEST’s first work plan, agreed with the Secretary of State in
November 1999, committed it to a number of projects:
a review of the funding agreements between DCMS and all its
sponsored bodies;
a review of business risk management within the sponsored bodies;
a study of how sponsored bodies can best make use of the
Internet to pursue commercial and public service objectives; and
an investigation into the cost and burden of Lottery application
processes.
Each project resulted in a report, approved by the Secretary of
State and published in the course of 2000, as a result of which, a
number of recommendations have been implemented:
a new single framework, along the lines recommended by
QUEST, has been introduced by DCMS for its new round of
funding agreements, with a smaller range of more meaningful
targets, and the agreements themselves focused more effectively
on strategic goals rather than current activity, underpinned by a
small number of Key Performance Indicators across all
sponsored bodies; and
cross distributor working on Lottery application processes, in
particular addressing the need for a consistent approach to the
information given to applicants and a simplification of the
information required of them.

Departmental Management, Resources and Expenditure

In June, QUEST agreed a framework for future work with the
Secretary of State which it used as the basis of consultation with
sponsored bodies and others. The framework suggested that future
studies should be based around three broad themes:
how sponsored bodies are best delivering specific Government
objectives for the cultural and sporting sectors, with special focus
on those areas where identifying and evaluating outcomes is
most difficult;
best practice in addressing management issues, focusing
primarily on:
understanding of the market,
commercial exploitation and innovation,
partnerships and collaboration,
and the most effective use of staff; and
the appropriate structures and relationships across the sectors,
between Government, first tier and further delegation of funding
and accountability.
QUEST put proposals to the Secretary of State for its next work
programme in December 2000, for a range of projects based on the
consultative framework. The work programme was formally
agreed and announced in January 2001.
Keith Oates, the Chairman of QUEST’s Advisory Board, resigned
as a result of ill health in March 2000. Sheila Forbes was appointed
to replace him from 1 November 2000. At the same time, Anne
Page was appointed to the Advisory Board.
4.22 DCMS in the Regions
The Department now has dedicated representation at senior level
in each of the nine Regional Government Offices, enabling greater
account to be taken of our sectoral interests. The new staff are
providing initial secretariat support to the Regional Cultural
Consortiums and will be critical in improving contacts within the
regions and with DCMS.

999059 DCMS Section 4-2001

Regional Cultural Consortiums
Regional Cultural Consortiums were set up in late 1999 in each of
the eight English regions outside London. The Consortiums are
working with Regional Development Agencies and other regional
and local partners to champion cultural and creative interests and
to promote the role of culture, tourism and the creative industries
in economic development, regeneration and social inclusion.
During the year they have consulted widely on draft regional
cultural strategies to draw together common issues and identify
regional priorities. These are due for publication before Easter; the
East Midlands strategy document was published in January.
There are analogous arrangements in London. Under the Greater
London Authority Act 1999 the Mayor has appointed a Cultural
Strategy Group which will draft and consult on a Cultural
Strategy for submission to the Authority during 2001.
Government in the Regions
The value of placing staff in each of the nine English Regional
Government Offices has been proved during the year. They have
provided a new focal point within Government, where the regional
contribution of the cultural and creative industries is referenced to
the wider cross-cutting priorities for education, social inclusion and
regeneration, and have provided essential support to the Regional
Cultural Consortiums. In line with the recommendations of the
Performance and Innovation Unit’s report recommending
strengthened Government Offices (Reaching Out: the Role of Central
Government at Regional and Local Level) the Department agreed to
integrate these staff into the Government Office structure and has
negotiated the transfer to the new arrangements with the newlyestablished Regional Co-ordination Unit.
Devolution
The Department has established good relations with all three
Devolved Administrations and officials meet regularly to review
the arrangements for consultation and to explore how the new
relationships can best be developed.

4.23 Local Government
Local Cultural Strategies
Final Guidance for local authorities on developing Local Cultural
Strategies was issued in December 2000. Cultural Strategies
provide a range of benefits, and can help promote social inclusion
and assist with regeneration. Having a cultural strategy is nonstatutory, but the importance of the initiative is indicated by the
fact that the possession of a Cultural Strategy is now a Best Value
performance indicator.
Best Value
Best Value, as enshrined in the Local Government Act 1999, aims
to ensure that each local authority makes a continuous
improvement in terms of the cost and efficiency of all the services
it provides. There are currently 11 Best Value performance
indicators. Setting indicators for the areas of DCMS activity is
difficult because of the discretionary nature of the services being
provided, but proposals for future indicators include one for
participation levels in culture and sport. This is to be worked up
for consultation in the coming year, together with an indicator for
tourism.
Beacon Councils – Regeneration
Four local authorities were awarded Beacon status in January 2001
for Regeneration through Culture, Sport and Tourism. The aim of
the Beacon Councils scheme is to raise the standard of local
authority services and to spread best practice. Beacon status
recognises councils that are excellent in a particular service or
cross-cutting area and have good performance across the board.
It requires them to share best practice with other councils through
a nationally co-ordinated programme of events.
4.24 International Unit
The Department’s International Unit was established in 1999 in
response to the Government’s deepening commitment to the
European Union and other international organisations such as
UNESCO, which the UK rejoined in July 1997. The Government’s
Step-Change initiative, whereby Ministers and senior officials are
urged to make every effort to make meaningful contact with their

999059 DCMS Section 4-2001

4/3/01

20:00

Page 127

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

127

opposite numbers in EU and Accession States, is taken very
seriously in DCMS. The International Unit co-ordinates this
activity and advises Ministers about the priorities of the StepChange, that is which countries it is most important to contact at
any given time. The Unit, in conjunction with the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, also advises on how to gauge the use of
Ministers’ time on incoming visits according to the Step-Change
and other priorities. In order to ensure that the whole Department
is aware of this new emphasis on EU and international work, the
International Unit has drawn up and put out for consultation a
Strategy Paper, which will be open to amendment as circumstances
change. The Strategy provides general guidance by which the
Department (and, where appropriate, its NDPBs) can develop
priorities for EU and international work in the face of limited
resources. While DCMS does not lead on the UK’s involvement
with UNESCO, it has a strong role to play and the International
Unit is the central point of contact between UNESCO, the newly
established UK National Commission for UNESCO, and the
Department. The International Unit is establishing closer links
with EU and the international Divisions in other Whitehall
Departments, as well as with UKRep in Brussels. We are also
establishing contact points with the cultural representatives in
Embassies abroad and with the British Council.
4.25 Cultural Property Unit
The Cultural Property Unit (CPU) is responsible for advising
Ministers on policy relating to moveable cultural goods, including
international issues, and for the operation of statutory schemes
affecting cultural objects in the UK.
In addition to having responsibility for the processing of all export
licences required for works of art, antiques and other cultural
goods, CPU also provides the Secretariat to the Reviewing
Committee on the Export of Works of Art. This committee makes
recommendations to the Secretary of State, with whom rests the
final decision as to whether to defer granting export licences for
objects of outstanding historical, aesthetic or scholarly importance,
giving museums, galleries, other institutions and private
individuals a last chance to raise money to purchase them.

In 1999–2000 six outstanding items were purchased by museums
and galleries throughout the country, where they will be accessible
to the public: the Swan Roll manuscript of c.1500, by Norfolk
Record Office; a Romano-British pottery vessel and an AngloSaxon sword scabbard mount, by the British Museum; an English
hand-knotted carpet of c.1600 by the Burrell Collection in
Glasgow, a George III period model of a gun howitzer, the
Carronade, by Falkirk Council Museum Services and John Russell’s
pastel portrait of 1792, One of the Porters of the Royal Academy, by
the Samuel Courtauld Trust for the Courtauld Gallery.
The Unit manages the Acceptance in Lieu Scheme which enables
works of art and other important cultural objects to be accepted
into public ownership in lieu of tax. Notable items accepted this
year include a rare panel painting by Cimabue entitled The Virgin
and Child enthroned with two Angels. This thirteenth-century Italian
masterpiece has been allocated permanently to the National
Gallery. The Victoria and Albert Museum has been allocated seven
groups of albums of mostly eighteenth-century architectural
drawings including a 15-volume set of drawings of Italian subjects
prepared for the 3rd Marquess of Bute. A major archive of papers
relating to the Earl of Stratford, the Marquises of Rockingham, the
Earls Fitzwilliam and Edmund Burke has also been accepted in the
year. Also accepted but not yet allocated are three Expressionist
paintings inspired by the Fife landscape by one of Scotland’s most
prominent twentieth-century artists, William Gear.
The Unit also operates the Government Indemnity Scheme which
indemnifies private lenders to museums, galleries and other
institutions when mounting exhibitions or taking in long-term
loans for either study or display. The Scheme has enabled many
popular exhibitions to take place this year such as the Holocaust
exhibition at the Imperial War Museum and The Art of Star Wars at
the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in
Bradford, West Yorkshire.
International issues for which CPU is responsible include the EC
Regulation on the export of cultural goods and the EC Directive
on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the

territory of a Member State, both of which are currently under
review, and the advisory Panels on Spoliation and on Illicit Trade.
The Illicit Trade Advisory Panel reported to Ministers in
December 2000 and recommended inter alia that the UK should
accede to the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of
Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer
of Ownership of Cultural Property.
The Spoliation Advisory Panel presented its first report in January.
It dealt with a claim by a Jewish family who in the early 1940s had
been forced to sell Jan Griffier’s View of Hampton Court Palace.
It had been acquired in 1961 by the Tate Gallery, who were unable
then to trace its history prior to 1956. The Panel recommended,
and the Government accepted, that an ex gratia payment of
£125,000 should be made to the family.
4.26 Government Art Collection
The Government Art Collection (GAC) is the only collection of art
for which DCMS is directly responsible. The collection comprises
around 11,800 works of art which reflect the breadth of British art
from the sixteenth century to the present day. The GAC also acts
in an advisory and administrative capacity for many more works
of art.
The GAC plays a significant role in promoting British art and
culture across diverse and international environments through the
display of its works of art in major Government buildings in the
United Kingdom and around the world. The GAC is responsible
for an ongoing programme of selecting and placing works of art in
key locations, which gives recognition to both historical and
contemporary Britain, and provides information on the major
works of art on display.
This year much of the GAC’s work has focussed on the selection of
works of art for the new British Embassy in Berlin, designed by
Michael Wilford. On behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office (FCO) the GAC commissioned three site-specific works for
the main public spaces of the building. These were Dancing

Columns, a sculpture by Tony Cragg (born 1949) in East German
sandstone, a large wall drawing (varnished pastel, measuring 16 x
44 metres) by David Tremlett (born 1945), and a light box diptych
by Catherine Yass (born 1963) showing images of two buildings
designed by the German architect Erich Mendelsohn, the Einstein
Tower in Potsdam and the de la Warr Pavilion at Bexhill-on-Sea.
Works of art from the GAC have also been placed in other areas of
the Embassy.
Displays were reviewed and new works installed in the Residences
of the UK Ambassadors in Madrid, Riyadh and Tokyo and of the
UK High Commissioner in New Delhi. In the UK, the GAC
installed new displays at 10 Downing Street, amongst other venues.
The commissioning of artists and the acquisition of works of art
are guided by the Advisory Committee of the GAC, whose Chair is
John Tusa. Additions to the Collection this year include four
photographs by Mark Power (born 1959) from his Shipping Forecast
series, a painting by Mike Silva (born 1970), Pathway through Park,
and a painting by Eugène-Louis Gillot (1868–1925) depicting the
arrival of King George V and Queen Mary of Teck at the Paris
Opera in April 1914.
In line with other institutions in the UK, the GAC carried out an
extensive audit in connection with the enquiry into art looted
during the Holocaust and World War II period in British
collections. Neither the GAC nor the FCO has found evidence to
link any of the works at FCO Posts abroad with looted works.
In order to assist with spoliation enquiries, the GAC is putting a
computerised database of its holdings onto its web site. This is due
to go online in spring 2001, providing a searchable access point to
the contents of the Collection and a source of information about the
GAC. It has been made possible in part by a major digitisation
programme over the past year of images from the GAC’s holdings.
The GAC has lent works of art to public exhibitions, including
Seven Hills: Images and Signs of the 21st Century (Martin-Gropius
Bau, Berlin), The Times of our Lives: Endings (Whitworth Art
Gallery, Manchester), The Essential Horse (National Horseracing

Museum, Newmarket), Ententes Cordiales (Mona Bismarck

4.27 Royal Parks Agency
The Royal Parks Agency was established on 1 April 1993 as an
Executive Agency of the Department and is responsible for
managing and policing the eight Royal Parks and a number of
other areas in London.
Review of 2000–01
Access, urban renewal and social inclusion
The Royal Parks provide 2,000 hectares of free open space in a
densely populated city, and the major share of the Agency’s budget
this year was allocated to the maintenance, restoration and repair
of its infrastructure.
Two highly successful projects to commemorate Diana, Princess
of Wales were inaugurated. The imaginative playground in
Kensington Gardens provides a safe environment for able bodied
and disabled children to play together, and the Diana Memorial
Walk follows a route through the central parks that has been
enhanced by extensive repairs and landscape improvements.
Discussions began with Sport for London to try to improve sport
facilities, especially for informal recreation at Regent’s Park.
White Lodge in Bushy Park was refurbished with the aim of
striking it off English Heritage’s ‘Buildings at Risk’ register in
2001.
Traffic management proposals for Richmond Park were put out for
public consultation.
The Agency applied for the renewal of its Charter Mark in
September 2000 and consulted interested parties on the proposed
changes to its Visitors’ Charter.

Green issues
The Agency contributed to local Biodiversity Action Plans and
supported the Westminster and Richmond groups and the Thames
Landscape Strategy.
In partnership with English Nature and the London Wildlife Trust
the Agency worked on a project to introduce a biological recording
system in the Parks. A pilot system was set up with a view to
introducing a park-wide system next year, if resources are available.
Promotion of physical and intellectual access to the parks
The Agency provided its annual programme of new and traditional
summer entertainment in each park, most events being free to
visitors. The programme included steel bands and brass band
concerts, classical music recitals, opera and theatre productions,
dance, nature walks and talks, and a host of children’s
entertainment, including football training with local First Division
clubs.
Hyde Park staged seven concerts. Party in the Park had a capacity
audience of 100,000 and Proms in the Park attracted 40,000; five
other seated concerts catered for audiences of up to 17,000.
Music ranged from pop to Latin American, providing a platform
for a variety of artists.
The Regent’s Park flower show attracted approximately 50,000
visitors.
The Royal Military Tattoo and the Queen Mother’s 100th birthday
parade were held on Horse Guards Parade in the summer.
When facilities for visitors were improved we ensured that they
were adapted for use by people with disabilities. Work included the
dropping of kerbs for wheelchairs and the improvement of
gradients and surfaces on the pathways in woodland and gardens.
(Alternative transport is available in some parks.) In partnership
with the Horse Rangers Association, we obtained sponsorship for
an indoor riding school in Bushy Park for disabled people.
Bushy Park has been working with local sports clubs to improve

999059 DCMS Section 4-2001

4/3/01

20:00

Page 133

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

133

facilities and increase the number of young people participating in
cricket, rugby and football.
The Agency’s environmental education centres in Richmond,
Bushy and Hyde Parks encourage children of all abilities and
cultural backgrounds to take an interest in the wildlife and history
of the parks. The centres, which are run by volunteers, have
developed strong links with local schools and visitor numbers
increased by 10 per cent this year.
The possibility of developing an education strategy to promote
environmental education opportunities across all the parks (subject
to available resources) is under discussion with the Royal Society
for the Protection of Birds, the London Wildlife Trust and the
National Maritime Museum. The Agency has become a member of
the DCMS Education Network.
Looking ahead: Priorities
In general, the Royal Parks Agency aims to make Londoners more
aware both of the opportunities available within the Parks and of
the needs and activities of the Agency, but it has also identified
certain specific objectives of particular importance:
to develop a full educational programme;
to research the Parks’ history, archaeology and ecological
opportunities;
to focus on areas of neglect, especially Bushy Park;
to work in partnership with our stakeholders and our neighbours
to develop schemes to enhance the green environment around
and outside the parks;
to develop further volunteer involvement;
to maintain excellence in horticultural standards, to ensure that
visitors can enjoy the parks in safety and to repair and maintain
their built fabric; and

to evaluate further sustainable maintenance regimes and to
ensure that grounds maintenance contractors follow best
conservation practices.
There will be limited funds available for tackling the maintenance
backlog, and these will be spent on essential works to meet Health
and Safety requirements, on programmes of routine and emergency
repairs and on the most major maintenance projects.
The Royal Parks Constabulary will continue its partnership
approach to community policing, developing local Parkwatch
schemes and promoting the work of community officers.
We are committed to improving the quality of visitor experience,
promoting access and education and increasing the amount of selfgenerated income.

DCMS Sponsored Bodies

Following the Comprehensive Spending Review, the Department committed itself to
a programme of rationalisation and reorganisation, both of the relationship that it
holds with its sponsored bodies and of some of the bodies themselves. The year
2000–01 has seen the consolidation of this process.
5.1 Funding Agreements and the new relationship
The 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) introduced
three-year funding agreements as the main focus of the
Department’s relationship with its sponsored bodies. In preparation
for the new round of agreements covering the 2001–04 period,
the Secretary of State asked the Department’s Quality, Efficiency
and Standards Team (QUEST) to review the current agreements
and make recommendations. QUEST looked in particular at ways
of measuring sponsored bodies’ contributions to delivery of the
Department’s strategic objectives.
Following extensive consultation with DCMS and its sponsored
bodies, QUEST published its report, A New Approach to Funding
Agreements, in September. The report offers a common framework
for funding agreements, the purpose of which is to allow the
Department to make more direct linkages between the DCMS
objectives and the activities of sponsored bodies. It also includes a
suggested list of generic ‘key performance indicators’, which
represent a first step towards the development of specific indicators
and targets appropriate to each institution. The Department
endorsed this approach and incorporated QUEST’s proposals in
the funding agreement guidance that was issued to sponsored
bodies in November. New funding agreements with each of our
sponsored bodies, focusing on key output targets, are now in place.
Funding agreements are one of the two main features of the new
relationship with sponsored bodies announced in the CSR, a
relationship based on ensuring the delivery of appropriate outputs
and benefits to the public. The other main feature is the
streamlining, where appropriate, of the control regime within
which sponsored bodies have to operate.

5.2 Structural changes
The aim of the Culture and Recreation Bill, published on
15 December 2000, is to reconfigure a number of the Department’s
sponsored bodies in various ways. It aims to:
reconstitute the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) as the
Sports Ground Safety Authority so that it can share its expertise
with sports other than football. The Bill also abolishes the FLA’s
current licensing regime as the Government believes this is no
longer necessary. The FLA’s duty to review local authorities’
discharge of their safety certification functions in relation to
Premier and Football League grounds will remain;
enable the creation of a new organisation, to be known as Culture
Online, which will make performing arts activities and cultural
treasures available to the public on the Internet, or via other
forms of digital technology;
enable the merger of English Heritage and the Royal
Commission on Historic Monuments in England (RCHME) by
providing English Heritage with powers to undertake functions
relating to underwater archaeology formerly carried out by the
RCHME. The Bill also expands the powers of English Heritage
so that it can carry out trading activities overseas;
provide the Secretary of State with a statutory basis for making
grants to the Arts Council of England (which has been funded
until now under the annual Appropriation Acts);
allow the Film Council, the Commission for Architecture and the
Built Environment and Resource to become statutory bodies and
provide the Secretary of State with a statutory basis for making
grants to them;
abolish the Library Advisory Council for England;
enable the Secretary of State to make an order, with the
agreement of the governing bodies concerned, to amend

999059 DCMS Section 5-2001

legislation in relation to appointments to the governing bodies of
certain national museums and galleries in England;
enable the British Library to establish subsidiary or trading
companies;
change the name of the English Tourist Board to the English
Tourism Council (ETC) and vary, or gives power to vary, the
membership of the ETC and other national tourist boards; and
enable the staff and former staff of various non-departmental
public bodies to be transferred to the Principal Civil Service
Pension Scheme.
The Greater London Authority Act 1999 makes provision for the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to give a grant to
the Greater London Authority (GLA), through the Mayor, to carry
out its tourism functions. Under Section 378 (1) of the Act the
GLA is subject to a duty:
(a) to encourage people to visit Greater London;
(b) to encourage people from outside the United Kingdom to visit
the UK by way of Greater London; and
(c) to encourage the provision and improvement of tourist
amenities and facilities in Greater London.
The GLA will assume responsibility for tourism in London on
1 April 2001. The Department has therefore been working closely
with the GLA, and other relevant tourism organisations, to draw
up an agreement setting out what the GLA will do and their
relationship with DCMS. Promoting tourism in London has, in the
past, been the responsibility of the London Tourist Board (LTB)
funded, in part, by DCMS through the English Tourism Council
and the British Tourist Authority. The GLA may continue to use
the LTB to carry out this work on their behalf.
A further provision of the Greater London Authority Act 1999,
passed management responsibility for Trafalgar Square and
Parliament Square to the GLA on 2 October 2000.

999059 DCMS Section 5-2001

From 1 April 2001, the National Film and Television School will
no longer be classified as an NDPB, and the Secretary of State will
no longer make appointments to its Board, although it will
continue to be part-funded by DCMS.
5.3 Public appointments
The Department plays a role in progressing around 600 public
appointments to a wide range of public bodies. Most of these are
national bodies and many have a high profile. Appointments are
governed by the principles of selection on merit through a fair,
open and transparent process. The Department is also committed
to taking positive action to raise awareness of women, members of
ethnic minorities and people with disabilities and to encourage and
their participation in public life. In addition, DCMS is also keen to
ensure that the boards of its public bodies reflect, as far as possible,
the make-up of society as a whole.
The Department is very pleased that it has reached and exceeded
its 2001 targets of 35 per cent representation by women and 5 per
cent representation by ethnic minorities one year early. Between
1997 and 2000, the levels of representation rose from 27 per cent
to 36.3 per cent for women and 2.1 per cent to 6.6 per cent for
ethnic minorities. The overall aim is to achieve year-on-year
increases that reach a level of equal representation by women and
men and 9 per cent ethnic minority representation by 2004.
For the first time last year, DCMS set a target for representation
by people with disabilities of 4 per cent by 2004. Since 1999,
representation has increased from 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
Applications are always welcome from those willing to serve on
DCMS public bodies. To register an interest, please write for
an application pack to: The Public Appointments and Honours
Unit, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Fifth floor,
2–4 Cockspur Street, London SW1Y 5DH (or telephone
(020) 7211 6387/6048). Information about DCMS appointments
and application is also available on the DCMS web site –
www.culture.gov.uk. Over the next year, DCMS hopes to develop

its website to advertise all vacancies and in this way to further
promote openness in the appointments process.
In addition, high profile appointments may be advertised in the
national press. The Department has established a database of
individuals who meet a broad range of competencies and who are
willing to serve on DCMS bodies, and all advertising and candidate
search is handled in-house.
5.4 Sponsored bodies tables and common core ﬁnancial tables
Details of all the non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), Public
Corporations, Regulatory Bodies and Advisory Committees that
DCMS sponsors, are outlined on the following pages.
Board members
The sponsored bodies tables give details of all appointments and
remuneration as at 31 December 2000. Individuals whose
appointments were due to end between 31 December and the
publication of this report may have been reappointed. Not all
appointments are made by the Secretary of State.
The majority of DCMS appointments are part-time and unpaid.
Remuneration attached to an appointment does not mean that the
current appointee chooses to draw payment. Where posts are full
time or paid they are identified in the tables by the following
symbols:
Key to tables
Up to £4,999

£a

£5,000 – £12,999

£b

£d

£30,000 – £44,999

£e

£f

Where remuneration varies within an individual body it is likely to
reflect the number of days an appointee works or the number of
committees on which they serve.

Financial information
Where appropriate, the financial information in the sponsored
bodies tables includes ‘Other Income’. This may include income
from other public sector sources as well as from the private sector,
but it is usually net of trading costs. Some figures in the tables may
not add up owing to rounding.

Regional Cultural Consortiums

DCMS has established a Regional Cultural Consortium in each of the eight English regions outside London. They are
charged with ensuring that culture and creativity have a strong voice in the developing regional picture and that they play
a full and coherent part in contributing to increasing prosperity and enjoyment of life in the region.
The Secretary of State appoints the Chairs of the Regional Cultural Consortiums. Nominations to the membership of the
consortiums are made by the regional arts, museums, heritage, tourism and sporting public bodies, library and archive
interests, the Regional Development Agency, and local government. Other interests may be invited to join the consortiums,
particularly from the creative industries and also from National Lottery distributors, countryside, recreation and
educational interests and the voluntary sector. The major task of each of the consortiums has been to draw up regional
cultural strategies that will set out the future of cultural, creative and sporting activity in the regions. These will be
published by summer 2001.

Arts Council of England

The Arts Council of England is the national body for the arts in England. It distributes Government Grant in Aid and
Lottery funds to artists and arts organisations, both directly and through the 10 Regional Arts Boards. ACE commissions
new work, conducts research, provides advice and information, and develops awareness and support for the arts in England.
The Arts Council’s three overarching priorities of access, education and excellence provide the national framework for the
work of the Arts Council and all ten Regional Arts Boards.
The Arts Council’s five strategic priorities are currently:
■ new work, experimentation and risk, and the centrality of the individual artist, creator or maker;
■ new art forms and collaborative ways of working, often in or with new technology;
■ diversity and public inclusion with special reference to race, disability and economic class;
■ children, young people and lifelong learning;
■ touring, and distribution through broadcasting, recording and electronic publishing.
These priorities are entirely consistent with the broad aim and objectives of DCMS. In addition, the Arts Council supports
the ten goals for the arts embraced by DCMS which provide the framework for the current funding agreement between the
two bodies.

Key achievements in 2000
The Arts Council of England persuaded Government of the necessity of increased public funding for the arts in 2002–04 to ensure that England’s arts communities survive
and thrive. ACE’s new structure, which places a strong emphasis on research, advocacy, the development of national policy and major new initiatives, as well as the
continuing role of funder of the arts, became ﬁrmly established. ‘The Next Stage’ was published in the summer, and sets outs ACE’s vision for the whole theatre sector,
including regional theatres, national and touring companies, and the commercial sector; detailed plans to implement the vision are being developed. The completion plan
for the ﬁrst capital programme continued and the second arts capital programme was announced. The Lowry Centre, Walsall Art Museum Gallery and Soho Theatre were
three of many outstanding ACE funded capital projects to open during the year. Responsibility for small Lottery awards was delegated to Regional Arts Boards, as well as
funding for 34 arts organisations. ArtsOnline.com, a major new virtual space for the promotion, exhibition and distribution of the arts in England, was launched in November.

Notes
For the ﬁrst year these ﬁgures include grants made through Delegate Bodies – in particular the Regional Arts Boards and the National Foundation for Youth Music Capital awards were reduced signiﬁcantly
during the year as the initial capital programme was being completed and the new Arts Capital Programme was launched. The Regional Arts Boards awards to Year of the Artist Residencies were largely processed
within the ﬁrst two quarters.
Applications to the Awards for All Scheme were signiﬁcantly reduced in the third quarter while a revised scheme was launched.
After the second quarter ﬁlm and ﬁlm franchise awards were made by the Film Council and are not included here.

British Broadcasting Corporation

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is the UK’s main public service broadcaster. Established by Royal Charter as
a public corporation in 1927, it was among the world’s pioneers in radio and television and has acted as a focal point for
the identity and culture of the nation.
Resources
The television licence fee provides the main source of ﬁnance for the BBC’s public services. In 1999–2000, total licence fee income was £2,286 million. The total turnover
of the BBC’s commercial activities was £464 million.
Main Activities
The BBC operates two national television channels, ﬁve national radio stations, radio stations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and 39 local radio stations. The
BBC operates World Service radio, which is separately funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofﬁce. In 1999–2000 the BBC broadcast 47,447 hours of programmes
on terrestrial and digital television, and 289,492 hours on national and local radio.
The BBC provides a range of digital services to all licence fee payers including: BBC 1 and 2 in widescreen, BBC Choice, BBC News 24, BBC Parliament and BBC Knowledge.
In June 2000 the Government announced new guidelines for the approval of BBC Public Services. The guidelines set a series of tougher tests, which will make the process
of approving new services more rigorous and transparent. The guidelines can be found on www.culture.gov.uk.
DCMS aims to ensure that the public’s interest in the BBC is safeguarded in the continuing development of broadcasting policy, including the BBC’s contribution to
digital broadcasting. The Department’s role is to monitor and oversee strategic decisions about the BBC, recognising that, within the framework of the Royal Charter
and Agreement, the BBC itself is primarily responsible for both the content of its broadcasting and its effectiveness and efﬁciency. The BBC is directly responsible and
accountable to its audiences and produces an annual Statement of Promises setting out the standards and services viewers and listeners can expect.
DCMS also takes the lead in advising on appointments to the Board of Governors, approves proposals by the BBC to expand its commercial services under the provisions
of the Charter and Agreement, sets the level of the television licence fee, makes and monitors legislation and regulations relating to the licence fee, approves licence
conditions and new methods of payment, and pays the Home Service Grant (which delivers to the BBC revenue equivalent to that received by the Government from the
licence fee). The BBC is responsible for issuing licences, enforcing the licensing system and collecting licence fee revenue.

Key Achievements in 2000
The Library handled its two millionth book request in its St Pancras building on 4 April 2000. There was a marked improvement in reading room book delivery times in
comparison with the previous year, with some 84% of requested items delivered within 90 minutes over the period April to November 2000.
Notable acquisitions included the Archive of Sir Laurence (Lord) Olivier, purchased with the assistance of funds from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Pilgrim Trust and the
Foundation for Sport and the Arts.
The Library awarded grants to a wide variety of organisations to support studies forming part of the Co-operation and Partnership Programme. The projects will further
collaborative approaches to collecting and making accessible library and information resources, to the retention and preservation of resources to ensure long term access
and to activities and mechanisms to ensure resources can be identiﬁed and located.
A contract was signed with IBM for procurement of a Digital Store to form the core of the Library’s infrastructure for handling the growing volumes of material received
in or converted into electronic form. From January 2000, the Library began to receive through voluntary deposit arrangements a number of UK published electronic titles.
The Library’s management hopes that a system of legal deposit for such materials will be established as soon as possible. The Library also began to formulate detailed
plans for the future development of its services in an environment where there is an increasing emphasis on electronic access and delivery. A number of reviews are in
progress, the results of which will help to shape the Library’s direction in such key areas as collection development, remote document supply and the provision of patent
services.
The Library mounted a major exhibition between March and October 2000 entitled ‘Chapter and Verse’, covering 1000 years of English Literature. This was followed from
November 2000 by ‘Oscar Wilde: a life in six acts’ which ran until February 2001.

Key Achievements in 2000
An additional emphasis for BTA in 2000 was on building stronger relations with the travel trade and strategic partners in the UK. A variety of tools were introduced with
this in mind, such as a dedicated help desk and website, a programme of educational surgeries throughout Britain, and an ongoing research project, known as the Britain
Assessment. The Assessment is a comprehensive benchmarking exercise to look at Britain’s competitive position in the world tourism industry.
Further investment was made in the fast growing ﬁeld of information technology. A strategy for BTA in the Digital Age was developed, which aims to exploit information
and communication technology to contribute to BTA’s success, both in the short term as well as the medium to long term. BTA carefully targeted its marketing,
concentrating on those customers with the best potential. A new Sports Tourism department, as well as an increased emphasis on Business Tourism and a global youth
campaign all helped to maintain the momentum for the development of inbound tourism to Britain. As a result, BTA aims to generate a return on public investment of
30 to 1 for 2000–01.

Broadcasting Standards Commission

The Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC) was established on 1 April 1997 by the Broadcasting Act 1996, through
the merger of the Broadcasting Standards Council and Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Combining the functions of
the two predecessor bodies, it acts as a forum for public concern about fairness and taste and decency on television and radio,
including satellite, cable, digital and text. The Commission considers and reaches findings on taste and decency complaints
received from the public and adjudicates upon complaints of unfair or unjust treatment in broadcast programmes and of
unwarranted infringement of privacy in programmes or in their preparation. It also undertakes and commissions research
and the monitoring of public attitudes, and must draw up a code of practice on both broadcasting standards and fairness
which the broadcasters and regulators are required to reflect in their own programme guidelines. The Commission is half
funded by the Department, half by contributions from the BBC, ITC, Radio Authority and S4C.

Key Achievements
During 2000, the Broadcasting Standards Commission published research reports on a variety of subjects and issues including Knowing the Score, which looked at the
depiction of drug-taking in broadcast media and ﬁlm. The report was published in conjunction with the BBFC. Listening 2000, published jointly with the Radio Authority,
looked at the public’s attitude towards radio. The report Delete Expletives? looked at words and phrases that cause offence and for the ﬁrst time included an in-depth
analysis of both press and poster advertising. Delete Expletives? was published in conjunction with the ASA, the BBC and ITC.
As part of its annual monitoring report, the Commission published two papers:
1. Regulation, the changing perspective, which looked at the public’s perception of broadcasting regulation, on both TV and radio.
2. Matters of Offence, which dealt with issues of concern including sex, violence, swearing and intrusion into people’s lives by TV and radio.
The Commission’s ﬁndings and its adjudications of complaints are published in its monthly Bulletin.
In 1999–2000, the Commission received 376 fairness complaints, of which 126 were eligible. 76 fairness adjudications were completed, of which 38% were upheld in full
or in part. In the same year, 3034 standards complaints were received which were within its remit and speciﬁc. During the year 2414 standards complaints reached a
Finding, and 25% were upheld in part or in full. The total number of complaints received during the year represented a 44% increase on those received in 1997–98.

Channel Four Television Corporation

The Channel Four Television Corporation is a self-funding statutory corporation providing public service broadcasting for
the fourth channel except in Wales. It has a statutory duty to provide information, education and entertainment to appeal to
tastes and interests not generally catered for by other channels; to encourage innovation and experiment; and to have a
distinctive character of its own.
Resources
Channel 4 is funded from the sale of advertising.
The Broadcasting Act 1990 established that in the event of Channel 4’s income falling below a certain threshold the difference would be made up by drawing on its
statutory reserve fund and by a levy on the Channel 3 companies. When advertising revenue exceeded a certain threshold, payments had to be made to the Channel 3
companies and to the statutory reserve funds.
The Broadcasting Act 1996 introduced a power to enable the Secretary of State to amend these funding arrangements by Order. This power was used to end the
requirement for payments to be made into the statutory reserve fund, with effect from 1997. It was also used to reduce the level of payments by Channel 4 to the
Channel 3 companies from 50% to 33%, with effect from 1998, and zero with effect from 1999.

Main Activities
In 1999 Channel 4 broadcast 8,760 hours of programmes and had a proﬁt before tax of £46 million.

Churches Conservation Trust (CCT)

The Churches Conservation Trust exists to preserve Anglican churches of heritage importance which are no longer required
for regular worship and for which no suitable new use can be found. It currently has 325 churches in its care and takes on
around 4–5 new ones each year. Virtually all the buildings are listed – mainly Grade I or II*.
The Trust’s resources are wholly devoted to the repair, maintenance and public presentation of its churches. It is increasingly
confronting the challenge of taking on major churches in unpromising inner-city locations and increasing access and
educational material on its churches.

English Heritage (Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England)

Key Achievements in 2000
At the end of 1999, EH was asked by the DCMS and DETR to lead a review of policies relating to the historic environment. A cross-sectoral steering group was set up
together with ﬁve specialist working groups representing a wide range of interests. In addition, the review was informed by a major public consultation exercise including
a major survey into public attitudes towards the historic environment and the value placed upon it, conducted by MORI. The ﬁnal report ‘Power of Place’ was presented to
Ministers on 14 December, setting out a clear agenda for the future role and needs of the historic environment in enhancing the quality of life in England.
In fulﬁlment of its role to encourage and promote an appreciation of the historic environment, EH welcomed around 11.8 million visitors to its 409 properties, including
some 6.0 million to staffed sites, of which 514,000 were free educational visits. EH also published information on access to properties it has grant aided on its website for
the ﬁrst time. For the ﬁrst time since 1984, access to Stonehenge at the summer solstice was made available free to anyone.
The year 2000 was themed by EH as the ‘Year of Public Sculpture’, to encourage awareness of public sculpture around the country. EH held a very successful exhibition
of ‘Sitouteries’ at Belsay Hall in Northumberland, inviting a number of high proﬁle architects and designers to provide a modern interpretation of a garden structure to ‘sit
out in’ and published a book of walks around ten English cities introducing the sculpture of the area. The importance of war memorials, which are a highly-valued form of
public sculpture, was recognised through a high-proﬁle grant scheme to encourage their preservation.
EH extended its Blue Plaque scheme outside London, with the erection of six plaques in Liverpool, and began to collect nominations in Birmingham, Portsmouth and
Southampton.
The National Monuments Record Images of England project to create a point in time photographic record of every listed building in the UK continued with the launch of
the prototype website, containing the ﬁrst 15,000 images taken by volunteer photographers.

English Tourism Council (ETC)

The English Tourism Council (ETC) is the national body for tourism in England. Its remit is to play a central role in
helping the industry and local communities gain maximum benefit from tourism; to drive forward research, improve quality
standards, promote best practice and innovation, coordinate data collection and analysis and act as a voice for successful
sustainable tourism in England. The ETC passes £5.5 million of its grant in aid to fund tourism in the regions, much of
which goes directly to the Regional Tourist Boards.

Key Achievements 2000–01
During the year, ETC – under the stewardship of its new Chief Executive Mary Lynch – consolidated its role as a strategic and high proﬁle national body in accordance
with the priorities laid out in the Government’s tourism strategy – Tomorrow’s Tourism. ETC operated its new arrangements for funding and monitoring the Regional
Tourist Boards (RTBs), which play a key role in the delivery of Tomorrow’s Tourism, enabling them to ensure coherence between delivering the national strategy and
responding to regional priorities and tourism issues.
Speciﬁc examples of important outputs during the year include: the launch of Action for Attractions – the attractions strategy to improve the quality and viability of the
sector; the England for Excellence Awards – highlighting quality and best practice in the industry; the England Image CD reﬂecting the England brand; ﬁnalising the Green
Audit Kit in partnership with the Countryside Agency; the launch of Perspectives on English Tourism reporting on the implications of tourism trends over the last ten years;
publication of the task force’s Resorts Regeneration Strategy; development of the ETC web site and the establishment of an EnglandNet partnership to oversee
e-business strategy.
ETC launched its quality standards for self-catering accommodation as well as its Stepping Stones Strategy, a practical stepped approach for lower quality accommodation
to achieve National Quality standards. In addition to publishing new versions of its acclaimed Where to Stay guides, ETC also produced its Pink Booklet – a practical guide
to legislation for accommodation providers. Consultations took place with the industry to produce standards for hostels, universities, and holiday centres.
The ETC engaged with the tourism industry at national level, principally through the Tourism Forum which is now supported by four short term task forces tackling:
transport, tourism trends, resorts and sustainable tourism. During the year, work also began on a number of other important projects for delivery in 2001–02, including
the Rural Tourism Strategy and National Accessibility Standards for hotels and self-catering accommodation. Finally, ETC was awarded its Investors in People accreditation.

Film Council

Established as an outcome of the Departmental Spending Review, the Film Council became fully operational in April 2000
and is responsible for all DCMS funding for film, both Lottery and Grant in Aid (apart from the National Film and
Television School). It is taking forward in parallel the two prime aims of Government policy: to develop film culture by
improving access to and education about the moving image; and to help develop a sustainable domestic film industry.
The Film Council will provide strategic leadership for the film industry, eliminating gaps and overlaps in provision, and
encouraging greater effectiveness and efficiency. It distributes Government Grant in Aid and Lottery funds for films and to
film organisations including the British Film Institute.

Key Achievements in 2000–01(1)
The launch of a number of ﬁrst stage UK-wide initiatives that include:
■

The reorganisation and reallocation of the public funds available to support the ﬁlm industry through three Lottery funds for ﬁlm: the Film Development Fund, the
Premiere Production Fund and the New Cinema Fund with a combined budget of £20 million a year. The aim is to produce better quality British ﬁlms, thus providing a
starting point towards creating a sustainable UK ﬁlm industry.

■

The Film Training Fund with a budget of £1 million a year to support training for scriptwriters and development executives, and separately to train business executives,
producers and distributors.

■

Development of a comprehensive European strategy to expand business and creative relationships with European partners.

■

A programme to stimulate the export of British ﬁlms and to exploit new opportunities opening up via internet distribution.

■

Increased support for the British Film Commission and its remit of attracting ﬁlm and television inward investment, leading to a record year for overseas production in
the UK.

■

A signiﬁcant expansion of the British Film Ofﬁce in Los Angeles as a conduit for attracting inward investment, promoting ﬁlm exports and co-ordinating Film Council
training programmes.

■

First Movies – a Lottery programme to run in 2001 with a budget of £1 million to resource hundreds of low budget short ﬁlms offering children the opportunity to
learn about ﬁlm-making and audio-visual storytelling.

■

The creation of a Market Intelligence Unit to provide authoritative statistics about the British ﬁlm industry for the beneﬁt of the industry itself, Government and
the media.

■

A package of speciﬁc measures to ensure that over time the British ﬁlm industry reﬂects the rich cultural diversity of the UK, and offers equality of opportunity and
access to individuals whatever their background.

■

Following an extensive consultation process, the launch of a development Strategy for Film in the English Regions ‘Film in England’. The aim is to provide a more
effective network between the regional ﬁlm bodies around England by committing up to £6 million each year to a new Regional Investment Fund. This will facilitate the
establishment of an integrated regional ﬁlm agency in each region with the capacity to determine its own industrial and cultural priorities for ﬁlm. The Council will
expect the agencies to produce business plans so that there is a ﬁrm structure for future funds. This will help to ensure a more efﬁcient and effective relationship within
regions, as well as between regions and with the Film Council.

In the ﬁrst year of operation, most of the Film Council’s targets were strategic as indicated by the key achievements listed.

Key Achievements in 2000
This year’s major exhibition, The House Beautiful – Oscar Wilde and the Aesthetic Interior proved to be both ambitious and highly successful, attracting critical and public
acclaim. With other exhibitions, including the ﬁrst show of furniture designer Matthew Hilton’s work, and imaginative education and public programmes, the museum kept
a high proﬁle and ensured the targets for visitor numbers were achieved. Internally there has been a signiﬁcant restructuring in the areas of ﬁnancial management and
security, as a result of the museum’s recent expansion. Plans to restore one of the museum’s early eighteenth century almshouses have progressed well, with funding
secured from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Ironmongers’ Company. The house will open to the public in 2001.

*The average cost of processing each application is not available on a quarterly basis. The average processing cost on an annual basis is estimated to be £2,000 (1999: £2,500).

Many more applications were made to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money in 2000. This mainly reﬂects the continuing success of the Awards for All scheme, which
widened the scope of organisations that could apply for Lottery grants. Standard application requests also rose in the year by 7%, to almost 1,250. These applications
were requesting grants of almost £720 million – a sum more than double our income from the National Lottery.
The work of the Heritage Lottery Fund does not end when the award has been made. Grants are only paid after work has been carried out to the satisfaction of the Fund
and its appointed expert monitors. This results in an ongoing commitment for the Fund in successful projects and there are currently over 2,300 projects being monitored.

Key Achievements in 1999–2000
Construction began on a £7.3 million extension (Phase 2 of the ‘Horniman 2001’ Lottery project), which will improve physical and intellectual access to the collections
and Gardens. The Museum was able to remain open for most of the year except for a planned 10 week closure period for reasons of public safety. Education teams
focused on outreach and taught 20,000 adults and children off site. Audiences included school children, refugees, elders and local neighbourhood groups. The DfEE-funded
project ‘Inspiration Africa’ facilitated creative work based on the ‘African Worlds’ gallery in primary, secondary and special needs schools. This work is documented on
www.clothofgold.org.uk/inafrica. An occasional paper series developed with the University of Coimbra, Portugal, was used to publish research by the two initiating
institutions but also provided an outlet for related research by the international academics and regional museums in the UK.

Independent Television Commission

The Independent Television Commission (ITC) is the statutory body created under the Broadcasting Act 1990 which is
responsible for licensing and regulating commercial television services in the UK. Under the terms of the Act the ITC is
charged with ensuring that a wide range of television services is available in the UK and that there is fair and effective
competition in the provision of such services.
Main Activities
The Commission licenses and regulates all commercial television services in the UK, regulating content of programmes, advertising and sponsorship as well as economic
and competition regulation of television services. The Commission also undertakes a full programme of engineering and audience research.
As at 1 January 2001, there were in force the following licences: 16 for Channel 3: Channel 4; Channel 5; 1 Public Teletext; 3 Commercial Additional Services; 5 Multiplex
Operators; 27 Digital Programme Services; 3 Digital Additional Services; 39 Local Delivery Services; 47 Local Delivery Transitional Services; 115 Prescribed Diffusion
Services; 98 Licensable Programme Services; 336 Satellite Television Services; and 20 Restricted Service Licences.
During 2000, the ITC continued its work on the development of digital television in the UK by issuing a major consultation with OFTEL and OFT on the availability,
affordability and accessibility of digital television. It is also working closely with Government on a detailed plan for digital switchover, has commissioned a number of
research projects to assess the potential coverage of digital terrestrial television and leads the UK’s Joint Planning Project on this issue.
The Commission embarked on an exhaustive programme of research into what viewers need and want from public service broadcasting (PSB). This consultation exercise
continued throughout the year, encompassing citizens’ juries, children’s workshops, a survey of 6,000 people on the Broadcasters Audience Research Board panel,
interviews with MPs, journalists and academics, plus a UK-wide series of public meetings, including a seminar with the National Consumer Council.
During the year, the ITC tested public and stakeholder opinion on a range of other issues including the proposed merger between Carlton and United News and Media,
the regulation of interactive services, and proposed revisions to the ITC’s Programme, Sponsorship and Technical Performance Codes. Responses were analysed and helped
to shape ITC policy on these issues.
The scheduling of the ITV Nightly News was also a major regulatory issue and following demands from the Commission to restore the news to an earlier time, agreement
was reached with ITV to restore the later evening news programme to 10pm Monday – Thursdays from January 2001.

Figures for 2000–01 are estimates based on projections and experience to December 2000.
The Commission’s work is increasingly focused on the delivery and monitoring of existing projects rather than the assessment of new applications.

Performance Targets
The Government requires all non-departmental public bodies to demonstrate how effectively they have discharged the mission which they have been set. To this effect,
the Millennium Commission has agreed certain key performance targets with the Government, against which annual performance can be measured. The table below sets
out all quantiﬁed targets, and their outturns, for 1999–2000.

Key Achievements in 2000
The Museum aims to Inspire a Passion for London. A number of major archeological discoveries caught the imagination of the public, including a stone sarcophagus
containing the remains of a young Roman woman. The museum staged fourteen exhibitions at London Wall, including a critically acclaimed history of dining out in the
Capital. The Museum also launched its Outsites programme, displaying historic items from the collection in locations as diverse as London Bridge Station and the Royal
Opera House. Likewise, our innovative Roman Boxes scheme took real Roman remains, replicas and teaching materials to London schools.

Key Achievements in 2000
2000 has been the Museum’s most remarkable year yet as the pace of development gathered ever greater momentum. The programme of building works was completed
and July saw the launch by Chris Smith of the New Look Museum with a host of facilities, upgraded services and even a more informal dress code for front of house staff.
The year began with the opening of the new Warehouse for the World exhibition, an innovative audio-visual experience portraying the life of nineteenth-century
warehouse workers, and was quickly followed by the launch of the Museum’s new restaurant, and the opening of both the refurbished and enlarged Conference Centre,
with a wider choice of room spaces and the upgraded Learning Centre designed to accommodate groups ranging from nursery and special needs to adult. In the summer,
a stylish new entrance building with an admissions area and a large, attractive retail unit came on stream, together with a separate orientation area with a staffed
information point, which is already proving popular, particularly with ﬁrst time visitors. Other developments included the construction of a network of smooth pathways
to facilitate better navigation across the 7.5 acre site and a new Boardroom Suite. The creation of a Collections Centre comprising additional accommodation for the
archive and object collections, and work to install a site-wide ICT and telephony network across the site continues apace. The year ﬁnished on a high note with the
granting of Charter Mark status. Despite disruption from the building work, visitor numbers were maintained at 300,000, retaining the Museum’s status in the top twenty
most visited charge-for-entry museums.

Other income comprises donations, bank interest received, net proﬁt on disposal of current asset investments, dividends and interest received on current asset investments, and tax reclaimed on dividends
received on ﬁxed asset investments. Current asset investments are managed by the National Investment and Loans Ofﬁce (NILO).

In response to the Government’s plan to increase grant in aid to NHMF to £5m for 2001–02 – the level of support which the Board of NHMF believes is the minimum at
which its business can be sustained – the Board decided exceptionally to make available up to £1.5m from the surplus in the endowment fund designated by the Board, in
addition to the £3.5m grant in aid for 1999–2000. With this level of resource, the Board decided that individual items which faced the risk of loss to the UK only by
export should again be an equal priority with other items which faced the risk of destruction, for example the breaking up of a collection. The Board continues to set
objectives of careful cash management and further reduction in administration costs. All the objectives were met.

Key Achievements in 2000
The key project supported by NHMF in 2000 was the offer of £3 million (payable over three years) for the endowment of the Foundling Museum, which was intended to
ensure that the collections of works of art and social history of the Foundling Hospital remained intact and on display in the original interiors. In addition, NHMF
supported two important treasure trove acquisitions. Somerset County Council Museums Service was awarded £125,000 towards the purchase of a hoard of 9,213 Roman
silver denarii discovered at Shapwick, the largest hoard of silver denarii ever found in Britain. Dorset County Museum was awarded £55,000 towards the purchase of a pair
of Bronze Age gold neckrings.

Key Achievements in 2000
The NLC is responsible for selecting the holder of the next licence to run the National Lottery when the current licence, held by Camelot Group plc, expires in September
2001. On 19 December the NLC announced its decision to award the next licence to Camelot Group plc.
The NLC has responsibility for licensing new games. During the year a new on-line game, Lottery Extra, has been licensed and the NLC has licensed the ﬁrst Instant game
offering a £1 million prize, and the ﬁrst Instant game offering non-cash prizes. The NLC also carries out extensive programmes of work to ensure the propriety of the
National Lottery and that the current operator complies with the terms of the licence.
As part of its responsibility for consumer protection the NLC undertakes research into players’ behaviour. This information is used to assist the NLC in ensuring that it
does not license games that would encourage excessive play or are attractive to under 16s. It also has a continuing research project for under 16 year old responses to the
National Lottery. The information is used to require the operator to instigate better procedures to guard against under age playing.

National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside

Key Achievements in 2000
The NMGM 2001 development scheme, supported by HLF and ERDF, got underway with both the expansion of the main collection store and new displays at the Museum
of Liverpool Life completed to time and budget, the latter opening to the public in July. Building works at the Walker Art Gallery and Liverpool Museum are progressing
with the opening of major new displays planned for 2001 and 2002 respectively. A reorganisation of the Education Service was begun. Free admissions for ‘Seniors’ was
introduced in April, and the continuation of the access support grant from DCMS enabled the headline price of the NMGM Eight Pass to remain at £3 for a further year.

Key Achievements in 2000
HM The Queen opened the Gallery’s new Ondaatje Wing on 4 May. This important building project provides more gallery space, greatly improved visitor facilities and a
home for the IT Gallery. At the same time, late night opening on Thursday and Friday evenings was introduced as part of the strategy to improve access. Visitor numbers
to St Martin’s Lane increased by approximately 20% so that, with visitors to the three regional partners, the total for the year exceeded 1.4 million. The Gallery continues
to devote considerable energy and resources to increasing electronic access to the collections: the IT Gallery has been very successful and website visits have more than
trebled compared to the previous year. Once again the exhibitions programme attracted large numbers of visitors.

New Millennium Experience Company Ltd (NMEC)

The New Millennium Experience Company Ltd has been responsible for developing, building and operating the
Millennium Experience at Greenwich and for developing and implementing the associated programme of events and
activities that took place throughout the UK. NMEC’s aim was to create an Experience that would attract, inspire,
entertain, educate and involve visitors and participants. It sought to influence positively each individual’s view of themselves
and the world’s view of the nation. NMEC became an NDPB in February 1997 when its shares were transferred to a
Government Minister, although it also remains a company under the Companies Act. Until December 1998 the shares were
held by the Rt Hon. Peter Mandelson MP; since January 1999 they have been held by the Lord Falconer of Thoroton.
Resources
The NMEC receives no voted expenditure from the Exchequer. It has a lifetime budget of £801 million, made up of a Lottery grant of £628 million (gross) from the
Millennium Commission with the remainder coming from sponsorship, commercial and other income.

Key Achievements
6.517 million people visited the Millennium Dome during the year 2000. 100% of schools/education authorities signed up for Learning Experience projects. Over 200
schools and communities participated in the McDonald’s Our Town Story initiative at the Dome. In excess of £300 million of business was awarded to contractors and
suppliers across the UK as a result of the Millennium Experience. The project has received a number of major awards including ‘The Royal Academy of Engineering
MacRobert Award 1999’, Britain’s premier prize for engineering and an award at the British Construction Industry Awards 2000. The Dome consistently achieved 88% –
90% satisfaction ratings throughout its year of opening, for the product and the service provided. At the annual Group Leisure Industry Awards dinner, the Dome was
voted Britain’s best new attraction. In addition, it has been a catalyst for the regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula and of the Thames Gateway.

Key Achievements
In its second full year of operation the Fund launched its second round of programmes, for cancer prevention detection treatment and care (£150 million), green spaces
and sustainable communities (£125 million) and community access to lifelong learning (£200 million).
Grant awards were made on the ﬁrst round of programmes: for healthy living centres (£300 million), out of school hours learning and childcare (£425 million) and ICT
training for teachers, school librarians and public library staff, and the digitisation of learning materials (£300 million). The Fund has fully committed £210 million and
made soft commitments (offers awaiting acceptance) of £158 million.
In developing and delivering its programmes the Fund has worked closely with Government Departments and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland
and Wales. The Fund has also seen its commitment to partnership bear fruit – for example, with health authorities and health boards, education authorities, voluntary
sector organisations and the local childcare partnerships.
The Government recently announced new initiatives for the Fund which will make available an additional £1.5 billion over the next three years.

Public Lending Right

The Public Lending Right (PLR) Scheme provides for registered authors to receive payments in proportion to the number of
times their books are lent from public libraries.
PLR helps DCMS achieve its wider aims for the sector through the financial and moral support it provides to authors.
Under the scheme every author whose books are read in public libraries has an opportunity to develop their talents further
and achieve excellence in their work. This in turn ensures the continued flow of new literature to libraries and underpins the
library community’s efforts to attract new readers and broaden access.

Key Achievements in 2000
The UK continued to lead internationally in the development of the PLR principle by extending the Scheme to authors resident throughout the European Economic Area
from 1 July 2000. First payments to European authors are due to be made in February 2002.
The case for increased funding for the Scheme made by the Registrar and the PLR Advisory Committee was accepted by the Secretary of State in the Departmental
Spending Review and the Fund will increase to £7 million with effect from April 2002.
The Rate Per Loan for the February 2001 payments to authors will rise to 2.49 pence (2.18 pence last year). As a result, 122 authors will receive the maximum payment of
£6,000, a 20% increase on the previous year’s ﬁgure.

Radio Authority

The Radio Authority is the statutory body created under the Broadcasting Act 1990 to license and regulate all independent
radio services. Under the terms of the Act, the Authority is charged with ensuring that a wide range of independent radio
services is available, which (taken as a whole) are of high quality and offer a variety of programmes calculated to appeal to
different tastes and interests, and that there is fair and effective competition in the provision of such services.
Main Activities
As at 31 December 2000, the Authority had in issue three national analogue licences, one national digital multiplex licence, 248 local analogue licences (including those
for seven local services newly licensed during the preceding twelve months), 20 local digital multiplex licences, one analogue additional service licence, and nine digital
additional service licences.
The re-licensing of existing local analogue services continued during 2000. Declarations of Intent were invited for 17 licences, and during the year 18 licences were
re-awarded to the incumbents. Five of these attracted competition from one or more other applicants, while the rest were re-awarded under the fast-track application
procedure introduced in the Broadcasting Act 1996. A further two local licences were renewed under the provisions concerning local licensees which provide digital
programming on a relevant multiplex. By the end of the year, 464 short-term licences were issued, and 89 long-term restricted service licences were in operation.
The Authority also had 67 satellite licences and 30 cable licences in force at the end of the year.
The Authority continued the process of advertising digital multiplex licences in 2000. It has committed itself to licensing one local digital multiplex licence a month during
2000 and 2001. As at 31 December 2000, the Authority had awarded 12 new local digital radio licences.
The Authority also issued licences on a rolling basis for the Digital Radio Advanced Feature Flex Transmissions (DRAFFT) project in London, a scheme sponsored by the UK
Digital Radio Forum to test advanced features of digital radio receivers. This included, for the ﬁrst time, licences which utilised a frequency from the L-Band part of the
radio spectrum.
The Authority issued 24 local Digital Sound Programme Service (DSPS) licences to potential digital programme providers. Seven national DSPS licences were issued to
non-simulcast programme providers. Nine digital additional service licences were also issued.
By the end of the year, the Authority revoked six satellite licences and three cable licences, all of which were at the request of the licensees. Channel Travel Radio, a
long-term restricted service licensee, also surrendered its licence.
During 2000, the Radio Authority implemented a series of major initiatives to increase openness and transparency. The Authority published notes of its monthly meetings
on its website, along with related agendas. A Register of Disclosable Interests and a Code of Best Practice for Members of the Authority were also made available on its
website. A Register of Gifts and Hospitality was placed in its Reading Room for public scrutiny. Its ‘purdah rules’, which govern the contact between Members and staff of
the Authority and licence applicants during the application period, were also modernised during the year. The Authority also consulted on and published a new Advertising
& Sponsorship Code and Engineering Code, and continued to publish assessments of successful applicants for radio licences.

Resource: The Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries

Following completion of its Spending Review in December 1998, DCMS announced the intention to create a new public
body to provide strategic leadership for museums, libraries and archives. As a result, Resource: The Council for Museums,
Archives and Libraries was established on 30 November 1999 to replace the Museums and Galleries Commission and the
Libraries and Information Commission. Resource became fully operational on 1 April 2000. It will work within the sector
to provide leadership and promote change; act as an advocate and champion and advise on best practice and delivery of
specific objectives.

Excludes provisions for DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge Fund and for Designated Museums Challenge Fund (see Detailed Allocation table that follows the sponsored bodies tables).

Key Performance Indicators
Work is in hand to ensure that all public libraries have Internet access by December 2002 and a two year programme to promote regional partnerships has been launched.
As a relatively new body Resource is still in the process of developing performance indicators.

Key Achievements in 2000–01
Following consultation with the museums, archives and libraries sector earlier in the year Resource issued its corporate manifesto in July 2000. This set out its work
programme for 2000–01. A review of CHNTO/ISNTO has been carried out and a report on its future produced. The basis for a new cross-sectoral standard for the delivery
of educational services to the public has been developed. A two year programme to promote regional partnerships was launched and advice given on ways in which
partnerships between national and non-national bodies might be developed. The operation of the Museums Registration scheme was reviewed and made more efﬁcient.
Future management arrangements for some of Resource’s advisory and executive functions were agreed. Work continued to ensure the successful roll out of the Peoples’
Network Project so that all public libraries are connected to the worldwide web by the end of 2002.

Key Achievements in 2000
The Royal Armouries underwent management restructuring in 2000 to create a team to develop and cultivate new ideas and bring a fresh approach to its revised
responsibilities. To celebrate the millennium it commissioned its ﬁrst work of music, ‘The Millennium Mass’, which had its inaugral performance at the Royal Albert Hall in
April 2000 and organised a millennium exhibition, ‘Tower 2000’ at the Tower of London. It launched its ﬁrst external retail outlet at the Yorkshire Mill Village in partnership
with Savills plc and organised and hosted a military tattoo at Fort Nelson.

Key Achievements in 2000
Following up the Commissioners’ report Archives at the Millennium, consultative meetings have been held on the future development of the Manorial Documents Register
and, through the National Museum Directors Conference, on the needs of archives held by the national museums. The Commission’s website and the public front-end of
the National Register of Archives (www.hmc.gov.uk) have both been updated and streamlined to facilitate public access. A major internal review was undertaken of the
Commission’s outreach and impact, and in preparation for the DCMS Quinquennial Review of the Commission, begun in November, a structural review was commissioned
from management consultants.

This lower ﬁgure reﬂects the change in payments to S4C from a single payment in January each year to monthly installments from January 1998. The 1997–98 provision accordingly only needed to cover three
months of S4C’s Grant in Aid.
Note
S4C is funded by Grant in Aid from DCMS, the level of which is set by statute. Under the terms of the Broadcasting Act 1990, S4C received a grant equivalent to 3.2 per cent of total television advertising revenues.
The funding formula was amended in the Broadcasting Act 1996 so that, from 1998 onwards, S4C would receive a sum equivalent to the 1997 grant uprated in line with the Retail Prices Index.

Main activities
In 1999 S4C broadcast 10,225 hours of programmes of which 4,388 were in the Welsh language.
The Broadcasting Act 1996 permitted S4C to establish commercial services and it has since set up S4C Digital Networks (SDN) Ltd.
S4C has been awarded the licence to operate one of the new digital terrestrial television multiplexes. S4C provides the digital television channels S4C Digital and S4C 2 in
addition to its analogue service. During 1999, S4C provided a daily 12 hour service in Welsh for the ﬁrst time.

* The Research Library can only seat up to 4 visitors at any one time and is open 41/2 days each week. The decrease in numbers after 1997–98 was due to an increased number of closed days for exhibition preparation.
# Four exhibitions were held at the Museum in 1999–2000, and in addition the curatorial staff prepared the major Soane exhibition at the Royal Academy.

Key Achievements in 2000
A major exhibition on Soane was mounted at the Royal Academy in 1999 and then shown at the Centro Palladio, Vicenza from April to August 2000. The Museum itself
held four exhibitions – an exceptional number – including two highly successful modern exhibitions, one on the work of the architect Frank Gelry, and the other an
exhibition of works by cutting edge artists, entitled Retrace your Steps: Remember Tomorrow. In the exhibition Visions of Ruin, the museum explored the cult of the ruin,
the ﬁrst exhibition on this theme in England.

Tyne & Wear Museums

Tyne & Wear Museums (TWM) is a major regional museum and art gallery service which is funded by the five
metropolitan district councils within the former metropolitan county of Tyne & Wear: Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne
(lead authority), North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland; and the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. TWM
is governed by a joint museums committee, comprising 23 elected members from the constituent local authorities.
A seventh funding partner of TWM is the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). TWM has been in receipt
of an annual central government grant since the abolition of the Tyne and Wear County Council, its former sponsor, in
1986. This Government grant is now paid by DCMS directly. A funding agreement is currently being drawn up between
TWM and DCMS. Through its access, education, and social inclusion and other activities TWM contributes to DCMS
objectives 1, 2, 3, 4 & 6.

Key Achievements in 2000
In June 2000 the £9m HLF funded Segedunum Roman Baths & Museum opened to the public within budget and to timetable. The new museum has already achieved
four national and regional awards for excellence.
Funding was secured from the Designated Museums Challenge Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund for the £1.5m Large Object Collections Centre. This regional
partnership with the Beamish Open Air Museum will ensure the long-term safe and secure storage for large items that are currently in temporary store.
Visitors to the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne, topped 350,000 and broke all time records for the Gallery. The showing of the Lindisfarne Gospels, on loan from
the British Library, attracted over 185,000 visitors over its 12 week showing at the Gallery.
The Millennium Fund outreach projects Objects of Desire and Making History ran throughout the year and enabled TWM to work with local communities on an
unprecedented scale in both curating exhibitions and in contemporary collecting.

UK Sport

UK Sport (the United Kingdom Sports Council) was established by Royal Charter on 19 September 1996 and became fully
operational on 1 January 1997. It focuses on high performance sport at the UK level with the aim of achieving sporting
excellence on the world stage. The work of UK Sport is all about building a framework for success – developing and
supporting a system capable of producing a constant flow of world class performers in a fair and ethical way.
UK Sport takes the lead among the home country Sports Councils in all aspects requiring strategic planning and
administration, co-ordination or representation for the benefit of the UK as a whole. It identifies sporting policies that
should have a UK-wide application and avoids unnecessary duplication and overlap in the way sport is administered
in the UK.
UK Sport is a Lottery distributor with responsibility for the distribution of 9.2% of the Lottery Sports Fund through the
World Class Performance and Events Programme.

Key Achievements in 2000
UK Sport’s Performance Services team continued to provide development support to sports of UK and international signiﬁcance in the run up to the UK’s most successful
Olympics and Paralympics in recent times. Signiﬁcant changes were also made to the World Class Performance Programme to assist sports in planning for Athens 2004
and beyond. Nearly £6m of Exchequer funding and over £23m of Lottery money was distributed to over 40 sports. The Ethics and Anti-Doping Directorate conducted
over 6,000 drug tests, of which 98.1% were negative. The Council also agreed a ‘Statement of Anti-Doping Policy’, which aims to provide national policy standards with
comprehensive and consistent guidelines to sports governing bodies in dealing with doping cases. Lottery money continued to support major events in the UK, with
nearly £900,000 distributed in 2000 and 14 events held. The money awarded also helped to secure a further 10 events to be held in the future, including the 2003 World
Indoor and 2005 World Outdoor Athletics Championships. The UK Sports Institute Central Services team was fully established as a division of UK Sport. 22 members of
staff were appointed with expertise in coaching, athlete liaison, sports science, sports medicine, technology and innovation, information technology, communications and
personal development programme development. ACE UK delivered career and education planning to a range of Olympic and Paralympic sports as well as other noncommercial sports and some of the major spectator sports.

Basis of measurement changed in 1998–99.
Distorted by inclusion of Lottery-funded project between 1998–99 and 2000–01; also lower in future years than historically becasue of effect of Quids In/free entry – generated income replaced by grant.

Key Achievements 2000
The V&A successfully reapplied for the Chartermark in recognition of its high-quality visitor services. It continued to expand its audience, securing HLF funding to build on
its successful work to date with the Chinese and South Asian communities and extend this work to new community groups. An experimental Contemporary Programme
attracted new audiences, particularly to Friday Late Views. The British Galleries continued on schedule and on budget for opening in 2001 with the period rooms the ﬁrst
objects to be reinstalled. Work continued on a partnership with the Shefﬁeld Museums and Galleries Trust in preparation for the ﬁrst of several loaned exhibitions to the
new Millennium Galleries. Important acquisitions included the Archive of Sir Michael Redgrave for the Theatre Museum and the Dacre Beasts for the British Galleries.
A project was initiated in conjunction with the School of Humanities at the RCA and the Bedford Centre for the History of Women at Royal Holloway, University of
London, to establish a Centre for the Study of the Domestic Interior, funded by a £850,000 grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Board.

All projects are funded either direct by DCMS or by DCMS NDPBs wholly from Grant in Aid.
All ﬁgures have been revalued to Estimate year prices using GDP deﬂators.
(3)
Dates shown for the year of start/completion refer to the main contracts. Only schemes on site during 2000–01 are shown in the table. Expenditure ﬁgures shown include preliminary expenditure prior to the
main contract and residual expenditure following completion of the work on site.
(4)
Figures based on agreed contract price.
(5)
The project is always considered in cash terms, these ﬁgures have not therefore been revalued to Estimate years prices using GDP deﬂators.
(6)
Historic Royal Palaces projects have not been wholly funded from DCMS. As an NDPB, HRP has no Grant in Aid for 1999–2000 onwards.

SARA MANZOTTI
AFTERNOON – JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Sara is currently studying printmaking technique at the London College of
Printing, having graduated from the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan.
Her choice of colours gives different levels of depth and light. Each work
reveals an episode from a story where windows and doors symbolise
openings into a space beyond the painted surface.
