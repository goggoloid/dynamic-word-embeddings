paragraph (1).

12.
(1)

application as the Administrator may reasonably require (whether in general or in relation
to a particular application).

communication directed to him by telephone, e-mail or SMS text message unless that

accept such communications.

14.
(1)

Determination of applications
As soon as practicable after receiving an application for assistance, the Administrator

Scheme the Administrator must notify the applicant in accordance with clause 15(1) and
(2) in relation to an application that has been duly made within the time scale specified in
the Code of Service Standards made under clause 28.

(3)

Where, in the course of determining an application for assistance, it appears to the
Administrator that the application cannot be determined without further steps being taken
by the applicant (such as the provision of additional information or such evidence as may

7

be duly required under paragraph 12(3)) the Administrator shall notify the applicant of
that fact and of the steps that need to be taken to enable the determination to proceed.
(4)

As soon as reasonably practicable after determining an application, the Administrator
must notify the applicant—
(a) that he (or, as the case may be, the person on whose behalf the application was made)
is not an eligible person, giving his reasons for that decision, or
(b) that he (or, as the case may be, the person on whose behalf the application was made)
is an eligible person,
and in either case the notification must provide information about the Scheme’s Internal
Review procedure and how to apply for an Internal Review of the Administrator’s
determination.

15.

Notification
A notification under clause 14(4)(b) shall also specify—
(a) the types of assistance which the eligible person is to be offered in accordance with
clause 17;

clause 16(1);
(c) if the eligible person is not entitled to the assistance free of charge, the specified
charge and the arrangements for paying it as mentioned in clause 16(2).

(2)

Where an eligible person has received a notification under paragraph 14(4)(b) the
Administrator must allow him a period of 14 days in which he may notify the Administrator
that he does not want to proceed with his application for assistance; and the Administrator
must not proceed with the application if he receives such notification.

(3)

In cases where an eligible person dies after the Administrator has issued a notification to
him under clause 14 (4)(b):
(a) the claim will continue in the name of another member of his household if that
member of the household is himself an eligible person and (for this purpose) any
change in entitlement to income support or protected payment which occurs as a
consequence of the death shall be disregarded;
(b) if none of the eligible person’s surviving household members is an eligible person,
at the choice of those household members, the Administrator must either continue to
provide assistance or refund any charge paid; or
(c) if the eligible person is not survived by any other household member the Administrator
is not required to continue to provide assistance where the deceased eligible person
was entitled to receive such assistance free of charge and shall refund to the estate of
the deceased eligible person or to the person who made it any sum paid in respect of
the specified charge for that eligible person’s claim.

8

16.
(1)

Entitlement to free or paid-for assistance
An eligible person is entitled to receive assistance free of charge if—
(a) he (or, as the case may be, a person acting on his behalf as mentioned in clause 11(1))
makes an application for assistance; and
(b) at the relevant time (within the meaning given in clause 8)—
(i) the eligible person,
(ii) his partner, or,
(iii) if the eligible person is a child, an adult who is a member of the same
household,
is in receipt of income support or a transition only payment in respect of Family Allowance
legacy.

(2)

An eligible person who is not entitled to receive assistance free of charge is entitled to
receive assistance in return for payment of the specified charge if—
(a) he (or, as the case may be, a person acting on his behalf as mentioned in clause 11(1))
makes an application for assistance; and
(b) the specified charge for that assistance has been paid.

(3)

In paragraph (2), references to the specified charge having been paid are references to
that charge having been paid in such manner and to such person as may be specified by
the Administrator; and the Administrator must ensure that there is a range of methods for
paying the charge suitable for use by eligible persons (but such methods need not include
payment by instalments).

CHAPTER 3: ASSISTANCE UNDER THE SCHEME
17.
(1)

Types of assistance available
The types of assistance to be provided to an eligible person shall be determined in
accordance with this clause, but subject to clauses 18 and 19.

(2)

It is for the Administrator to—
(a) determine in accordance with Schedule 4 which type of assistance from those
described in paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 3 will in his opinion constitute the most
cost effective option of assistance which can be provided to eligible persons in the
Channel region;
(b) determine whether any upgrade equipment may be offered to eligible persons
choosing the most cost effective option of assistance in the Channel region, and the
additional payment required for such equipment;

9

(c) determine in accordance with Schedule 5 whether any alternative assistance as
described in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 is to be made available to eligible persons
in the Channel region; and
(d) subsequently, notify the applicant (pursuant to clause 15(1)) of the assistance which
can be offered to the eligible person.
(3)

The Administrator’s notification must—
(a) offer assistance determined in accordance with paragraph (2)(a);
(b) provide information about—
(i) any upgrade equipment; and the level of the additional payment payable by
the eligible person for the provision of that equipment (as determined for the
purposes of paragraph (2)(b)), if chosen by the applicant; and
(ii) the operation of the upper limit and the circumstances in which a review of the
most cost effective option of assistance for the eligible person may occur; and
(c) offer assistance determined in accordance with paragraph (2)(c) (if any); and
(d) provide information about—
(i) that assistance; and
(ii) the appropriate payment which will be made to an alternative provider of that
assistance, if chosen by the applicant.

(4)

In this clause—
(a) “the additional payment”—
(i) is the amount by which the cost to the provider of the most cost effective option
of assistance of providing the upgrade equipment chosen by the applicant (as
determined in accordance with that paragraph) exceeds that of providing the
equipment included in the most cost effective option of assistance for eligible
persons in the Channel Islands region, as determined in accordance with
paragraph (2)(a); and
(ii) does not include a reference to any sum payable by virtue of regulations made
under section 364 of the Communications Act 2003 (TV licence fees).
(b) “alternative assistance”, in relation to an eligible person, means such types of
assistance described in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Main Scheme as are to be
made available to that person;
(c) “alternative provider”, means a provider of assistance comprising television services
described in paragraph 2(2)(b) of that Schedule;
(d) “the appropriate payment” means a payment made by the Administrator to an
alternative provider, following a referral of an eligible person to that provider by way

10

of alternative assistance, of an amount determined in accordance with paragraph 5(2)
of that Schedule;
(e) “upgrade equipment” means any other equipment that the provider of the most cost
effective option of assistance may offer to eligible persons in the Channel region
choosing the most cost effective option of assistance, in return for which an additional
payment is due; and
(f) “the upper limit” means the maximum cost, as determined by the Project Board from
time to time, and in accordance with paragraph 5(2)(c) of Schedule 2 to the Main
Scheme (value for money), which may be borne by the provider of the most cost
effective option of assistance where chosen by an applicant.
(6)

Where—
(a) alternative assistance is chosen by an applicant,
(b) the Administrator has referred the eligible person to an alternative provider and made
the appropriate payment to that provider, and
(c) the 14 day period referred to in clause 15(2) has expired,

the Administrator shall not be required to take any further action in relation to the delivery of
assistance under this Scheme to that eligible person, unless the alternative provider refers the
eligible person back to the Administrator in accordance with the provisions of this Scheme.
(7)

It is for the applicant to tell the Administrator which type of assistance offered he has
chosen to receive.

(8)

In this clause, in relation to any equipment, “provision” includes the delivery of that
equipment to the eligible person’s home.

18. Provision supplemental to clause 17
When making a determination under clause 17(2)(a), the Administrator must take into account,
in relation to the location of the homes of eligible persons—
(a) the predicted or actual digital terrestrial signals available for reception of the public
service television channels after digital switchover at that location;
(b) any guidance from Digital UK or Ofcom on the availability of digital terrestrial
services at that location or generally; and
(c) the predicted or actual availability of digital television services other than digital
terrestrial television at that location.
19.
(1)

Operation of the Upper Limit
The Administrator must review the determination made under clause 17(2)(a) in relation
to a particular eligible person where—
(a) the Administrator has notified an applicant of the most cost effective option of
assistance in accordance with clause 17(2)(a);
(b) that person has chosen the most cost effective option of assistance and informed the
Administrator of that choice;
11

(c) the provider of the most cost effective option of assistance has subsequently assessed
the home of that particular eligible person in relation to the delivery of the most cost
effective option of assistance; and—
(i) reasonably estimates that the cost of providing the most cost effective option of
assistance, to provide for the reception of the public service television channels,
exceeds the upper limit as defined in clause 17(5), and
(ii) informs the Administrator of that estimate; and
(d) the Administrator approves the estimate in paragraph (c).
(2)

Where the Administrator—
(a) reviews the determination in clause 17(2)(a) pursuant to paragraph (1), and
(b) determines that, in the case of the eligible person in question, a type of assistance
that is, in that person’s case, cheaper than the most cost-effective option of assistance
should be provided,
he must re-notify the applicant in accordance with clause 14(4)(b) and clause 15.

(1)

Other obligations of the Administrator

comply with determinations of the adjudicator.

33.

Digital UK
The Administrator must make arrangements for the co-ordination and (where appropriate)
integration of Digital UK’s generic communications with other communications connected

unavailable, the BBC will be relieved of its obligation in clause 2(2) to provide assistance
under this Scheme to the extent to which it is no longer possible for it to do so.

(3)

The use of data supplied by a public provider of information for purposes other than a
function of the Scheme is not permitted.

any Memorandum of Understanding as may be agreed between [DSHS Ltd] and the public
providers of information.
36.
(1)

Charitable and other not-for-profit organisations
The Administrator must make such arrangements, as it considers appropriate for the
provision of further help to those who have received help under the Scheme, and for
providing funding for the implementation of such arrangements.

(2)

Those arrangements should, so far as possible, be made with charitable and not-for profit
organisations.

37.
(1)

Suspension of Scheme
The provisions of this Scheme are conditional on no decision or judgement being made
by a competent body in relation to any provision of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union or legislation based upon the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union (“EU law”) in respect of the Scheme which has the direct or indirect effect of
preventing or obstructing the operation or funding of the Scheme. If any such decision or

23

judgement is made or threatened by a competent body, the Secretary of State may suspend
the continued operation of the Scheme until such time as suitable arrangements have been
made or suitable steps have been taken so as to allow the implementation of the Scheme
to continue without being prevented or obstructed by the decision or judgment made or
threatened under EU Law.
(2)

Any suspension of this Scheme in accordance with this clause is not to be taken as a
breach by the BBC or the Secretary of State of their obligations under the Agreement or
this Scheme. The costs of any suspension will be met from the provision set aside for the
Scheme described in paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 of the Main Scheme.
