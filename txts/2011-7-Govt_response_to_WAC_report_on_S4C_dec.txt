Select Committee

Introduction
The Government welcomes the report and has considered very carefully the evidence
presented to the Committee. The Government notes the conclusions and
recommendations set out in the report and is pleased to be able to present its
response.

Response to conclusions and
recommendations

1. We welcome the significant contribution that S4C has made to the Welsh economy
since 1982. S4C and the independent television sector, from which it commissions
much of its output, contribute approximately £90 million per year to the Welsh
economy and are responsible for employing over 2,000 people. This is a story of
success for the Welsh economy and should be built on in the future.
3. We welcome the key part that S4C has played in bolstering the everyday use of the
Welsh language, which we consider to be a cultural asset not just of Wales but of the
entire United Kingdom. Through a wide range of its broadcast output, S4C has brought
the Welsh language into many homes where it may not have been heard previously. In
addition, S4C has provided the opportunity for Welsh people to learn, through its
education and children's programmes, and hear their language spoken as a normal
part of their daily lives. We also recognise, however, that while the cultural benefit
provided by S4C is compelling, the channel's prime purpose is to provide its viewing
audience with popular, high quality television programmes which inform, educate and
entertain.
Response to 1 and 3: The Government recognises S4C’s contribution to the
Welsh economy, particularly the Welsh independent production sector, and to
Welsh cultural life. It is for this reason that the Government secured the future
of S4C in the Comprehensive Spending Review.
2. We note concerns that too much of the economic benefit from S4C is gained by the
region in and around Cardiff where S4C headquarters and most independent
television producers in Wales are based. While we are not presently persuaded of the
case for moving S4C from Cardiff in the current economic climate, we do, however,
consider that it merits consideration at a future date. In the meantime, we urge the
DCMS and S4C to make every effort to spread S4C's activities beyond its established
bases to all corners of Wales.

Select Committee

Response to 2. Whilst this is a matter for S4C, the Government agrees that S4C
should be encouraged to do more to spread the benefits of its public funding
throughout Wales.
4. We note the claims by a number of witnesses that the figures provided by BARB
and used by S4C to judge its performance are not reliable, particularly because they
take no account of the number of viewers under four years old. We regret the
misleading use of these figures by some commentators and note that the BARB
figures are regarded by the BBC, S4C and other commentators as the industry “gold
standard”. We have not been presented with any compelling evidence to suggest that
the figures produced by BARB are unreliable.
5. We recognise that S4C is operating in a competitive and fast-moving digital market
where television viewers have a much wider choice of channels than ever before. In
the light of this, it is a positive achievement that S4C’s share of the viewing audience
during peak times in recent years has held up remarkably well.
6. By presenting figures for those who watch S4C for just three minutes or more a
week, S4C’s viewing figures appear more impressive than when using the
comparative 15 minute metric reported by the BBC and Channel 4.
7. While 3 minute reach may be a useful metric to assess the commercial impact of a
channel that carries advertising, S4C, as a public service broadcaster, should be
assessed on a range of measures, including the number and proportion of those who
watch the channel for at least fifteen consecutive minutes a week, a standard figure
published by the BBC—including for its smaller, niche audience channels. We
recommend that S4C include 15-minute reach measures in its future reporting.
8. Assuming the number of Welsh speakers is approximately 600,000 people, the
viewing performance of some S4C broadcasts including the Welsh language fictional
drama Pobol y Cwm, and Pawb a’i Farn compare favourably with equivalent BBC
productions such as Eastenders and Question Time.
9. It appears that the majority of Welsh speakers do not watch S4C for three
consecutive minutes a week. Approximately 155,000 Welsh speakers watch S4C for
at least 15 consecutive minutes a week. This is a figure on which S4C itself
acknowledges that it must improve.
12. We recognise the high quality of some of S4C’s output, such as its children’s
programming and drama. It is also the case that S4C has reached and continues to
reach significant audiences with particular programmes and coverage of events.
Response to 4-9 and 12: The Government believes that greater value-for-money
can be achieved for the public funding that S4C receives. Whilst there have been
some ratings successes, the Government envisages that the new S4C
governance and funding model will provide greater opportunities for value-formoney arising from synergies and efficiencies. This will help to secure the
future financial security of Welsh language broadcasting.

5

10. We recognise that S4C could perform better and therefore recognise the case for
creating a new S4C: a multi-platform, multi-media broadcaster/publisher, which is
answerable to Welsh audiences, and commissions and broadcasts Welsh language
content only.
Response to 10: The new partnership with the BBC will explore these features
and there will be a review of S4C’s strategy and finances before the end of the
Spending Review period.
11. The BBC states that the output it provides S4C is highly valued by S4C’s
audience, accounting for about one fifth of S4C’s total output yet attracting around two
fifths of the channel’s viewing. Our findings confirm this.
Response to 11: The Government is aware of the value placed on the BBC
contribution to S4C’s programming. This arrangement will be preserved under
the new partnership.
13. The DCMS should ensure that greater information about S4C’s audiences and
performance should be available to policy makers and the public. Although we
welcome S4C’s joint study with the Welsh Language Board on audience perceptions
of S4C, we are surprised that it has taken the S4C Authority until now to address this
shortcoming.
Response to 13: The Government recognises the importance of providing
information to audiences. As an independent broadcaster, however, S4C itself
has a responsibility to provide such information. The Government encourages
S4C to do more on this under the new governance arrangements and to seek
ways to maximise transparency.
14. Spending per head on broadcasting output in Wales is the highest of any of the
four UK nations, driven particularly by public funding of S4C. While we received no
hard evidence that S4C was operated inefficiently, the fact that S4C intends to reduce
40 administrative staff within the next year indicates there have been opportunities to
make savings without necessarily affecting the quality of the channel’s broadcast
output.
19. While S4C must, like other public sector organisations, share its burden of cuts to
its funding, we recognise the risk that this will come at a cost to the quality and volume
of S4C’s output. The DCMS, S4C and the BBC must work together to identify
potential synergies and to eliminate wasteful duplications so that the impact of cuts
to S4C’s funding is minimised.
Response to 14 and 19: The Government’s vision is that the new partnership
with the BBC will result in synergies and efficiencies that benefit both S4C and
the BBC. The Government will take this recommendation into account and
ensure that these are given careful consideration as the discussions are taken
forward.

6

15. We are concerned that S4C has for many years received substantial sums of
public money without sufficient internal or external evaluation of its efficiency and the
value for money of its service. The DCMS, over a number of years, has failed to
provide this assurance. This is unacceptable and we recommend that the DCMS take
immediate steps to redress the gap in S4C’s financial accountability by subjecting
S4C to regular audits by the National Audit Office.
Response to 15: S4C’s financial accountability under the new partnership
arrangements is currently under discussion and the Government will take this
recommendation into account as the discussions are taken forward.
16. We are surprised that the BBC uses licence fee money to purchase private health
care. We are also concerned that S4C has over a number of years provided private
health care insurance for more than 100 employees. Although in May 2009 this
benefit was not offered to new employees, it was not closed to existing staff. This has
clearly been an inappropriate use of taxpayers’ money, even more so at a time when
the public sector, including S4C, is charged with making sometimes painful
efficiency savings. S4C should set an example to other publicly funded broadcasters
and end immediately this taxpayer-funded perk for all employees.
17. We conclude that, although there is scope for making efficiencies in its operations,
in terms of providing Welsh language broadcasting, S4C provides value for money.
Response to 16 and 17: As independent broadcasters, staff remuneration for
S4C and the BBC is a matter for the individual bodies.
The Government believes, however, that the value-for-money of S4C can be
improved and will seek to ensure that the service achieves greater value-formoney under the new partnership arrangements and funding levels.
18. The Government proposes to significantly reduce public spending over the course
of this Parliament. In the light of this, it would be difficult to justify the ring-fencing of
S4C’s funding. Any reduction in S4C’s funding should be comparable to other public
service broadcasters. We call on the DCMS to ensure that this is the case.
20. We recommend that the Government confirms the funding of S4C beyond 2014-15
as soon as possible. Without this certainty, S4C will not reasonably be able to develop
its future strategy. Therefore, we believe that it is essential that there is a long term
funding formula enacted in primary legislation.
21. We recommend that the DCMS work with the BBC and S4C to determine how
S4C’s funding can be guaranteed. We further recommend that S4C receive in full a
portion of the Licence Fee which is at least equal to the amount set out by the DCMS
in S4C’s funding review settlement.
22. The proposal that most of S4C’s funding should in future be provided through the
licence fee is a significant development. We welcome the Government’s and the
BBC’s commitment that the S4C programme budget will continue to be spent on

7

Department for Culture, Media and Sport
Select Committee

commissions from independent producers in Wales and call on the Government to
ensure that this commitment is included in the documentation outlining the
arrangement between S4C and the BBC.
Response to 18, 20-22: The new funding and partnership arrangements ensure
that S4C’s financial future is safeguarded.
The Government has secured ring-fenced funding for S4C for the entire
comprehensive spending review period up to March 2015. This should be
welcomed in the current fiscal climate and goes beyond the security given to
many other public bodies. Beyond the spending review period, the Government
is committed to ensuring that the new partnership arrangement will guarantee a
level of funding that is sufficient to allow S4C to deliver its public service remit,
as enshrined in legislation.
In line with other publicly-funded bodies, the Government cannot, however,
confirm at this stage what that level of funding will be post-2015. The level of
funding will be informed by the review of S4C’s strategy and funding, which is
scheduled to take place before the end of the current Spending Review period,
once the new partnership has had time to bed in. The long-term performance of
the service should be determined by outputs rather than by financial inputs and
these outputs will be defined following the review.
The Government does not intend to implement a funding formula in legislation.
However, as we have already committed, the Secretary of State will ensure that
S4C has sufficient funding to deliver its public service remit.
The new partnership arrangements will reflect the Government commitment that
all of S4C’s commissioning budget will be spent in the independent sector, as
now.
23. During 2010, the S4C Authority Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Head of
Commissioning, left their positions in S4C, within six months of each other. These
events gave the impression that S4C was more concerned with its internal differences
than with its primary responsibility: the sound stewardship of a cherished institution.
24. We conclude that, whatever the deficiencies of Arwahanrwydd, its failure was
primarily due to the failure of individuals in S4C to make the arrangement work,
rather than any critical fault with its structure. The situation was compounded by the
absence of any official or public explanation by the Board about the reasons for their
departures. We are concerned by S4C’s admission that its website did not include the
minutes of any meetings of the Authority since December 2009.
25. The failings of the Authority to provide effective leadership for S4C during 2010
was particularly regrettable as it came at a time when the funding and governance of
the organisation were in doubt. For a time, instead of being known for broadcasting
drama, S4C became a drama of its own. S4C must never allow such a sorry situation
to occur again.

8

Department for Culture, Media and Sport
Select Committee

Response to 23-25: The Government will take into account the findings of the
Shortridge review of S4C’s corporate governance in creating the new
partnership arrangements. The new Chair of S4C is fully aware of the recent
governance difficulties and the Government is confident that he will work hard
to make the new governance arrangements a success.
26. On the evidence we received, it is apparent that the decision to fund S4C via the
licence fee from 2013 onwards was made in haste. In a matter of hours a deal was
struck between BBC executives and Ministers in London, without sufficient
consultation with relevant parties. This is regrettable.
Response to 26: Given the scale and pace of the spending review and TV licence
fee agreement discussions, it was not practical to have in-depth discussions
with all interested parties ahead of the announcement. The timeframe reflected
the Government’s desire to put the UK’s finances in order.
27. We welcome the commitment made by the DCMS and the BBC that S4C’s
editorial and operational independence will be maintained under any new partnership
arrangement between the organisations. However, we have concerns about how this
will work in practice. We call on the Government to spell out exactly how this
independence will be guaranteed under the new arrangements.
28. We are concerned that the BBC, a national broadcaster and much larger
organisation than S4C, will not necessarily have the particular interests of Welsh
language programming as its primary focus. We note the possibility that under any
new structure, S4C’s distinctive voice will go unheard. We call on the Government and
BBC to guarantee publicly that S4C remain solely a Welsh language broadcaster.
Response to 27 and 28: The detail of the new partnership arrangements is still
being discussed and an announcement will be made in due course. The
Government remains committed to the future of S4C as a strong and
independent Welsh language broadcaster, retaining its editorial distinctiveness.
This no intention of removing S4C as a statutory body nor merging it with the
BBC. S4C’s current public service remit, as enshrined in legislation, will remain
and it will be the Secretary of State not the BBC who will continue to exercise
powers of appointment over the Chair and of the S4C Authority. The
relationship will be on the basis of a partnership.
29. We recommend that under any partnership made between the BBC and S4C,
careful thought needs to be applied to any role played by the BBC Trust, to ensure that
S4C’s editorial and managerial independence is not compromised. We call on the
Government to consider the appointment to the S4C Authority of individuals of
sufficient independence and stature. Under any future management structure that is
put in place, the management team responsible for the day to day operation of the
channel, should comprise only S4C personnel.
Response to 29: The governance arrangements under the new partnership are
still to be finalised but the Government has made clear that S4C will remain an

9

Department for Culture, Media and Sport
Select Committee

editorially distinct service. We have re-iterated that the relationship will be as a
partnership.
30. We were pleased that the Government listened to concerns about S4C’s inclusion
in Schedule 7 of the Public Bodies Bill and by its subsequent decision to remove it
from that part of the Bill.
Response to 30: At present, S4C is in Schedule 3 and Schedule 4 of the Public
Bodies Bill. This is to give the Government the powers to modify S4C’s
constitutional and funding arrangements in order that the planned changes to
S4C can be implemented. The Government is committed to consulting on S4C’s
new governance arrangements.
31. We note the arguments for devolving responsibility for S4C from the DCMS to the
Welsh Assembly Government. Although we do not accept that now is the appropriate
time to take this step, we do accept the case for an enhanced role for WAG and the
National Assembly in the funding and scrutiny of S4C. We therefore recommend that
the DCMS and WAG should consider an arrangement whereby WAG contributes to
the funding of S4C and that the S4C Authority appear annually before the relevant
Committee of the National Assembly for scrutiny of its Annual Report and Accounts.
Furthermore, any future Broadcasting Bill should address the relationship between
DCMS, Welsh Assembly Government and S4C.
Response to 31: The Government has no plans to seek funding from or make
S4C accountable to the Welsh Government. Such a move would undermine the
important principle that broadcasting is a reserved matter, to which the
Government is fully committed.
Ministers are, however, fully aware of the desire of the Welsh Government that
its views are taken into account. The Government is committed to consulting on
S4C’s governance changes and we will ensure that the Welsh Government is
kept informed of this process. The Government continues to have discussions
at official level and this provides the opportunity for the Welsh Government to
feed in views as appropriate.
33. The Welsh Affairs Committee will also continue to monitor closely S4C and the
terms of any partnership deal that it concludes with the BBC. We expect to take
evidence again from S4C during this Parliament to gauge the success of the new
arrangements.
Response to 33: The Government welcomes the views of the Committee on the
partnership arrangements.
34. We are disappointed that, despite having the statutory right to do so, the DCMS
has not undertaken a review of S4C. This has given weight to the argument of those
that claim that the UK Government does not adequately appreciate the importance of
S4C to Wales.

10

Department for Culture, Media and Sport
Select Committee

We recommend that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport should
commission an independent review of S4C at least once every five
years.
35. We believe passionately in S4C and recognise its importance to the preservation
and promotion of the Welsh language. However, in the light of the events of the last
year, we recognise the need to rebuild trust in the governance, management and
mission of S4C. As a first step in the process of building trust, we recommend that the
DCMS commission a wide-ranging independent review of S4C. This review should
consult the wide range of parties with a stake in the broadcaster and should consider
fundamental issues such as S4C’s purpose, the appropriate size, scale and scope of
the institution and its services, and its future funding and governance arrangements.
Response to 34 and 35: The Government is fully aware of the importance of S4C
and is committed to consulting on the new governance arrangements with all
interested parties.
The Government envisages a review of S4C’s strategy and finances to conclude
in good time before the end of the period covered by the Comprehensive
Spending Review. The frequency and nature of future reviews will be balanced
against the independent status of S4C.
