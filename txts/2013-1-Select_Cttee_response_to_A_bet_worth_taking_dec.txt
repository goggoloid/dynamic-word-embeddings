Introduction
1. The Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the conclusions
and recommendations of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee
(“the Committee”) report on the implementation of the Gambling Act 2005.
Like the Committee, we recognise the importance of gambling as a
legitimate part of the leisure industry and the contribution it makes to the
economy, both as part of local tourism and leisure offers and as a
significant employer nationally.
2. Nonetheless, while we recognise that for the majority of people gambling is
a harmless pastime, for some people it can be a source of serious harm
and distress: we believe there is an obligation on the industry to address
the social issues associated with gambling.
3. The Government therefore welcomes the new voluntary arrangements put
in place by the gambling industry for funding, as well as for commissioning
and evaluating research, education and treatment into problem gambling. It
is important that the whole industry delivers on the funding commitment
made as part of the new arrangements which it agreed to as an alternative
to a statutory levy.
4. We hope these new arrangements will, in the medium to longer term, put in
place an improved evidence base to help us evaluate what works in terms
of education and treatment. Having such an evidence base may justify a
shift in the emphasis of regulation towards more adaptable and flexible
harm-minimisation measures which can incorporate technological
innovation and are tailored to individual players and their circumstances.
5. Alongside this, online gambling is a prominent part of the agenda and the
Government remains committed to ensuring customers are protected by
consistent regulation of the online market. We are therefore proceeding
with proposed changes to the regulation of remote gambling to ensure that
all gambling operators selling into the British market are licensed by the
Gambling Commission and have asked the Committee to scrutinise the
draft Bill published on 3 December 2012.

The Government’s Response to the
Recommendations
6. In this section the Government sets out its responses to the conclusions and
recommendations of the Committee’s Report (“the Report”). In referencing
the Committee’s recommendations we use the paragraph numbers given in
the body of the Report. In the interests of clarity, we have occasionally
grouped recommendations.
Problem Gambling
We recommend that the Government works with the Gambling
Commission to provide a clear indication of how it intends to ensure that
sufficient high-quality research on problem gambling is available to
policy-makers. It is particularly important that research is seen to be
independent and comparable over time to show whether or not there is a
change in the levels of problem gambling. (Paragraph 32)
7. The Government agrees with the Committee that research into problem
gambling must be objective and consistent; we are equally concerned to
ensure policy decisions are made on the basis of sound evidence. The new
arrangements for commissioning and evaluating research will help us to
achieve these objectives.
8. Under the arrangements, the Gambling Commission’s advisory body on
research, education and treatment, the Responsible Gambling Strategy
Board (RGSB) now sets strategic priorities for research needed to
understand problem gambling; its strategy for 2013/14 to 2015/16 was
published on 3 December 2012. Within this strategic framework, research
into the risk factors associated with gambling and the most effective harm
prevention and treatment for problem gambling will be commissioned by
the Responsible Gambling Trust (RGT).
9. These arrangements are set out in a Statement of Intent published in
August 2012 and which can be accessed at http://www.rgsb.org.uk. The
arrangements are designed to ensure the objectivity and consistency
required to deliver the necessary evidence base. In particular, the
arrangements for working collaboration and transparency will enable the
RGSB to provide assurance on the quality and independence of the work
commissioned by the RGT. We also welcome the recent appointment of a
number of new trustees to the RGT from outside of the gambling industry
as a demonstration of its commitment to objectivity.

10. The Gambling Commission advises on the prevalence of gambling and of
problem gambling. It has been developing new methods of data collection
which have the potential to provide more frequent information in relation to
gambling prevalence and trends in problem gambling. Improved quarterly
omnibus surveys will provide information about participation, whilst
gambling questions in the Health Survey for England and Scottish Health
Survey will provide problem gambling data. The individual components are
designed to ensure that the research is independent and will give
comparisons over time. Both the Health Survey for England and the
Scottish Health Survey are currently in the field and will begin to report their
findings from December 2013. Similar data is not collected in the Welsh
Health Survey, although the absence of data collected from Wales should
have limited statistical impact on the results for Great Britain and their
comparability with previous surveys.
11. As well as these methods of assessing participation and problem gambling
rates, the Gambling Commission has also explored and piloted the use of a
problem gambling mini-screen (PGSI short-form) as an additional and
different means of tracking changes to the problem gambling rate. The
mini-screen continues to be piloted in the Commission’s telephone omnibus
surveys and could, over time help to identify emerging trends in problem
gambling rates.
Under-age Gambling
We recommend that the Gambling Commission continue to monitor the
ability of children to access gambling premises through regular testpurchasing schemes rather than handing the responsibility to monitor
and enforce age-restrictions to the gambling industry. The Gambling
Commission, working with local authorities, should also take swift
enforcement action where an operator fails to introduce sufficient
access and age-verification controls. (Paragraph 38)
There has been insufficient data collected to establish whether or not
the 2005 Act has been successful in its aim of protecting children from
gambling. This highlights a particular need for more research in this
area. (Paragraph 39)
12. The Government welcomes the Committee’s recommendations in this area:
ensuring gambling sectors have adequate age verification procedures is an
area on which both we and the Gambling Commission place great
importance.
13. In 2009, the Gambling Commission conducted a test purchasing scheme in
major operator betting shops. The failure rate – 98% of shops failed to
prevent a young person placing a bet even after deliberate interaction with

6

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

counter staff – was of enormous concern and the Commission pushed the
betting operators concerned to address these very serious failures.
Operators subsequently invested heavily in improved training, analysis and
customer awareness programmes to improve controls on underage access,
resulting in a very significant increase in the numbers of people challenged
in betting shops and unable to prove their age.
14. As a result, retesting on major betting operators in December 2009 showed
the failure rate had reduced to 35% (with a spread of around 25-40%). In
2009, as noted by the Committee, the failure rate in Adult Gaming Centres
was approximately 29%1. While any level of failure is a matter of concern,
the gross failures that had been evident previously appear to have been
eliminated and performance in the betting sector is now broadly
comparable to that of the retail of other age restricted products. The
Gambling Commission will continue to work with the industry to secure
further improvements.
15. As a result of the Gambling Commission’s intervention, major operators
(and a growing number of medium size operators) now test the
effectiveness of their controls through the use of independent third party
test purchasing. This allows for test purchasing on a much larger scale than
had been completed by the Commission. Since February 2010, over
22,000 independent tests have been commissioned by operators. The
Commission, working with local authorities, ensures the industry provides
the necessary information on third-party testing to enable the local
authorities and the Commission to monitor compliance and take
enforcement action when necessary. The Commission undertakes a further
limited amount of test purchasing to cross check the effectiveness and
accuracy of the third-party testing and act as an additional deterrent.
16. The Gambling Commission has also published advice to licensing
authorities on test purchasing in the gambling sector and continues to work
with authorities across Great Britain to produce a more complete picture of
test purchasing work. One area of concern highlighted in part by the
industry’s own test purchasing work and also in exercises carried out by
some licensing authorities, is that there may be vulnerabilities in terms of
access by under-18s to gaming machines in betting shops. The
Commission will therefore be focusing on this aspect of underage access
over the coming year. This may involve the Commission carrying out its
own test purchasing or partnering with licensing authorities to do so.
1

The Committee’s report quotes a 65% failure rate for betting operators in 2010. However, the
failure rate for major betting operators in 2010 was actually 35%, reducing from 98% in 2009. A
limited sample of small independent operators who were tested at the same time for the first
occasion did have a 65% failure rate. The Gambling Commission is working with local authorities
to ensure that smaller betting shops/arcades are targeted for underage testing, both to act as an
incentive for compliance and to respond to local intelligence of potential problems.

7

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

17. In addition to the collection of data which illustrates the risk of underage
people accessing gambling inappropriately, the Gambling Commission and
the RGSB has identified children and young people and gambling as a
priority area for research and for the development of effective education
and harm prevention strategies. An expert group on young people’s harm
prevention is being funded to ensure that the strategies chosen are the
most effective.
Gaming Machines
Casinos are the most highly-regulated sector and they are therefore the
most appropriate venue for hard, high-stake forms of gaming. We
believe that it is illogical to restrict the games available in highly
regulated land-based casinos when B2s, with high stakes and prizes,
can be accessed in betting shops. The Government should address the
current imbalance by permitting casinos to operate up to twenty B2-type
machines with a maximum stake of £100. (Paragraph 53)
18. The Government agrees with the Committee that casinos are the most

appropriate venues for high stakes gambling. That is why casinos are
already permitted to offer up to twenty Category B2 machines if they so
wish. However, in practice the majority of gaming machines made available
in casinos are category B1 rather than B2. Casinos are also uniquely
permitted to offer semi-automated and fully-automated table games.
We recommend that research be commissioned by the Gambling
Commission to assess the potential of types of gambling to contribute
to problem gambling levels, in particular whether there is a link between
features including speed of play, stake and prize levels, accessibility and
numbers of gaming machines, and problem gambling. (Paragraph 57)
19. The Government agrees with the Committee about the importance of
understanding better the relationship between different types of gambling,
including machine gaming, and problem gambling. This has been a
longstanding priority area for the Gambling Commission which has asked
its advisors, the RGSB, to see what more can be done to better understand
the risks that machine gaming might pose to public protection objectives.
The RGSB’s strategy prioritises this area, and the RGT will commission
independent machines research starting with a scoping study which was
announced on 30 November 2012. Information on the study is available on
the RGT’s website at www.responsiblegamblingtrust.org.uk. The work is
still in its early stages, but will ultimately help to:
•

Benchmark the impact of current and new machine structural
features on gaming machine play;

8

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

•
•
•

Explore the potential of machine player data to identify markers of
problematic machine gambling behaviour;
Understand the feasibility and effectiveness of new player-led harm
minimisation tools;
Understand the wider needs in terms of wider prevention and
treatment activities to support any changes in the impact from
gaming machines upon problem gambling levels and the
corresponding need for treatment services.

20. The overall aim is to ensure there is a well-structured multi-faceted
research programme for machines which helps inform and guide policy
decisions.
The 2005 Act has had the unintended consequence of encouraging the
clustering of betting shops in some high streets by removing the
demand test and limiting the number of B2 machines permitted in each
premises. The clustering of betting shops is a local problem which calls
for a local solution. We therefore recommend that local authorities be
given the power to allow betting shops to have more than the current
limit of four B2 machines per premises if they believe that it will help to
deal with the issue of clustering.
The limit of four B2 machines under current legislation should be
maintained as a minimum limit to create certainty for operators.
However, if problems arise with individual betting shop chains or
premises in connection with B2 machine use, local authorities should
have—as a safeguard—the right to require the removal of any machines
over the minimum allowance. (Paragraph 66)
We support the original vision behind the 2001 Gambling Review Report
in which bingo halls were to be maintained as social, soft gambling
environments. In the case of Adult Gaming Centres we believe that they
provide a controlled adult environment and have robust access controls,
as demonstrated by their low failure rate in the Gambling Commission’s
test-purchasing scheme. We therefore recommend that Adult Gaming
Centres are permitted B2 machines on the same basis as betting shops.
(Paragraph 69)
21. The Government also acknowledges the widespread concern many have
about the impact of betting shops and category B2 machines on local
communities. These concerns have increased in profile following the
publication of the Committee’s report. However, the causal links around
these types of machines and problem gambling, and ways to mitigate the
risks, remain poorly understood. It would not be right for the Government to
consider any liberalisation with regard to category B2 machines until
evidence is in place, potential options for harm mitigation are better

9

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

understood and the industry has demonstrated its capability to manage
better the harm its products may cause to some customers. The research
announced by the RGT will inform longer term policy decisions but, in the
shorter term, the Government will also review evidence around B2
machines and problem gambling and has asked for evidence as part of its
consultation on changes to gaming machine stake and prize limits.
It is clear that commercial snooker clubs have suffered
disproportionately from the removal of B3 machines and are now
struggling to remain profitable. We therefore recommend that
commercial snooker clubs be permitted to offer B3 machines.
(Paragraph 71)
22. It is not clear that the difficulties experienced by some commercial snooker
clubs can be attributed in whole or in large part to the lack of access to B3
gaming machines. Nor is it clear that those difficulties would be relieved by
permitting such clubs to offer B3 machines.
23. Moreover, in the absence of a better understanding of causal links between
gaming machine and problem gambling, category B machines should
remain the preserve of genuine gambling operators, subject to the strict
controls expressed in the Gambling Act, licence conditions and codes of
practice. It would be wrong to permit snooker clubs – which are
environments in which alcohol is available – to make such machines
available without requiring them to meet the same requirements as other
operators. It would also be extremely difficult to justify making this privilege
available solely to snooker clubs and not to the many thousands of other
clubs up and down the country, many of which may also be struggling.
Better evidence needs to be available about problem gambling before any
increase in the availability of B3 machines can be considered.
We welcome the Government’s position that further changes to machine
stakes and prizes should be evidence-based. (Paragraph 73)
It is important that the likely effectiveness of any measures for tackling
problem gambling is assessed before such measures are put in place.
We recommend that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport seek to
learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions, such as Australia,
which have implemented measures to combat problem gambling
including educational programmes and machine displays showing time
spent on them. (Paragraph 74)
24. The Government strongly supports and encourages the development of
player-focused harm mitigation measures: the feedback of information
about play sessions to players (such as machine displays showing time and
money spent) is one example which we understand to be already feasible

10

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

in technological terms. There are other examples of such measures
perhaps slightly further away from the current British market such as card
based systems that would pool play information across a range of
operators, providing players with much better tools to manage their own
behaviour (for example by setting financial limits) and developing the
industry’s capability to identify those who get into difficulty with their
gambling and to intervene appropriately. We see this as the key to
unlocking the scope for future innovation in the gambling market.
25. The Government also welcomes the Committee’s acknowledgement of the
importance of evidence-based research. The Gambling Commission (in its
position as statutory advisor) constantly reviews developments, including
the research from international jurisdictions. As called for by the
Commission’s review of research, education and treatment, its advisor, the
RGSB is working on the creation of a national responsible gambling
information hub, which will provide a central point of access to research
and statistical information dealing with gambling-related harm. This will cut
duplication and streamline activities aimed at improving our collective
understanding of the evidence
26. The Gambling Commission also works actively to encourage the sharing of
information and best practice amongst international regulators. This
happens through the Gaming Regulators European Forum and the
International Association of Gaming Regulators, as well as meeting with
international visitors when in Britain. The Commission is also a member of
the European Association for the Study of Gambling which allows the
Commission access to a wide range of international research and best
practice and an extensive network of researchers.
27. The Government published a consultation on proposed changes to gaming
machine stakes and prizes in January 2013 as a result of the reintroduction
of the triennial review process. Increases in the stakes and prizes are
proposed where we, and the Gambling Commission, believe there is low
public protection risk, but we will take a more cautious approach in other
areas, most notably with category B2 machines where we will review the
evidence around links to problem gambling and ask for evidence as part of
the consultation. We also think that the development and trialling of
measures such as individual player protection are an important part of the
direction of future regulation and, as part of the triennial review, we have
asked for views on whether such approaches could be trialled as part of B1
machine stake and prize level changes in casinos.
Tackling Problem Gambling
We recommend that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
develop a public information campaign outside of gambling premises to

11

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

highlight sources of help for problem gamblers and their relatives. The
Government should also make an assessment of the ability of existing
support and advice centres to deal with any significant resulting rise in
demand. If a significant increase is expected then the industry should
fund, out of the existing voluntary levy, increased provision of advice
and support by these existing centres. (Paragraph 77)
28. The Government notes the Committee’s recommendations on the need to
highlight sources of help for problem gamblers and their relatives, and to
ensure that appropriate levels of advice and support is available to those
who seek assistance as a result. The Government and the Gambling
Commission agree strongly that effective harm prevention and mitigation
measures are critical. The Commission has therefore considered
prevention and treatment of problem gambling by a range of measures a
key priority since it began operation. The measures which have and are
being taken to achieve this aim include: licence conditions to ensure the
signposting of assistance to gamblers in gambling premises and on
websites, information required to be made available on all gambling
advertising and the creation of a national problem gambling helpline and
online equivalent, with appropriate levels of support available through those
sources.
29. The RGT allocates funding to research, education and treatment
programmes in line with the RGSB strategy. The Government notes, for
example, that the RGT has recently signed a new three-year agreement
with GamCare to secure the provision of treatment services for gamblers
and others adversely affected by gambling. This agreement offers the
opportunity for GamCare to improve and expand the services that it has put
in place over the last 15 years with the potential of a £500,000 (26%)
increase by 2014/15.
30. The Gambling Commission has further asked the RGSB to provide advice
on how best to get advice and help to those who need it. The experience of
other countries in this area is highly relevant to this advice.
31. Ultimately, however, it is in the industry’s own interests to identify and
implement measures that provide genuinely effective protection for those of
its customers who, for whatever reason, cannot manage their gambling
behaviour effectively. Success in this area will be critical to generating the
public confidence that lend more support to the industry’s proposals to the
way that it is currently regulated.
We recognise the significant practical challenges that introducing a
national “universal” self-exclusion system would involve, including
confidentiality and legal issues. However, the Government should
support the development of a system which would allow a customer to

12

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

self-exclude from all forms of gambling regulated by the Gambling
Commission. (Paragraph 81)
32. The Government considers self-exclusion a useful tool to help those who
are experiencing problems with their gambling and welcomes the
Committee’s contribution to the issue. Under current requirements set by
the Gambling Commission, operators must offer self-exclusion and
encourage the customer to exclude from relevant local operators, as well
as refer the individual to the treatment options open to them. A number of
operators offer self-exclusion across all of their company’s premises and
products, but there is currently no national self-exclusion database.
33. As the Committee has identified, a national self-exclusion programme
presents issues with confidentiality and legal concerns. The Gambling
Commission is concerned about the potential unintentional consequences
of a national programme if based on staff recognising those excluded,
which could make exclusion at a local level less effective. This is especially
true in a retail environment where it becomes more difficult for staff to
identify self-excluded individuals if they have to consider all those who have
been excluded across the country. It is a priority that individuals find that a
self-exclusion agreement is ‘enforced’ effectively in their local environment.
A national programme could therefore make self-exclusion less effective in
a retail environment, such as betting and arcades, unless players have to
register and establish their identity before playing.
34. It is highly desirable to identify schemes that cover a large proportion of
gambling outlets to help those at risk exercise self-control. The Gambling
Commission continues to explore ways to extend self-exclusion across
operators and is actively pursuing this with the industry. The development
of technologies, such as the use of loyalty cards, may offer advantages for
self-exclusion and the Commission continues to explore these options as
they emerge. In addition, the Commission is also working with the industry
to identify where sector-wide self-exclusion databases may be appropriate
and could be enforced effectively.
While it is important that the option of enforcing a compulsory research,
education and treatment levy be maintained, we recommend that the
current voluntary levy is continued. However, should one or more
sectors of the gambling industry fall short in their duty to fund research,
education and treatment programmes, the Government should
implement a compulsory levy on those sectors. (Paragraph 84)
35. The Government welcomes the Committee’s acknowledgement that the
voluntary levy has the potential to be successful. The Government
maintains that the industry must meet the agreed funding targets and
retains the option of introducing a compulsory levy on one or more sectors

13

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

should the voluntary system fail. In this respect, it should be noted that
although the RGT (the industry-led body charged with raising funds from
the industry and disbursing them in line with the strategy recommended to
the Gambling Commission by the RGSB) has made very good progress in
broadening the funding base, it remains the case that the vast majority of
the funding comes from comparatively few operators.
We recommend that, in designing successor arrangements to the
tripartite agreement for the funding of research, education and
treatment, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the
Gambling Commission focus on minimising overlap between the
responsibilities and activities of the bodies involved as well as ensuring
effective communication between them. While the Responsible
Gambling Strategy Board continues to advise the Gambling
Commission, and through it the Government, we believe that the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport should also take a more proactive role in identifying the research needed for strategic policy
development and ensuring that these needs are reflected in the research
being carried out. (Paragraph 91)
36. The Government agrees with the Committee that the overlap between the
relevant bodies should be minimised and since the Committee’s report was
published, new arrangements for research, education and treatment have
been implemented, which are aimed at promoting collaboration. The
Department looks to the success of these new arrangements as a
mitigation against the need to introduce a statutory levy at this time. A key
test of the new arrangements will be the extent to which they deliver the
evidence that the Government needs to make decisions about regulatory
policy, in particular to provide confidence that decisions to increase or
reduce regulatory burden can be made with the fullest possible
understanding of the risks to children and vulnerable people and how they
might be mitigated.
37. We welcome the joint Statement of Intent published in August 2012 by the
Gambling Commission, the RGSB and the RGT which demonstrates the
renewed commitment each of these organisations have to effective and
transparent partnership. The Government, through the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport, has been involved in developing strategies for
research to inform policy development, for example contributing to
Gambling Commission and the RGSB’s work to identify the necessary
research to inform the triennial review of stakes and prizes. It remains the
case, however, that the Gambling Act creates a specific duty for the
Gambling Commission to advise the Government on matters relating to
gambling and its regulation, which it carries out with energy and
professionalism; it would be a costly duplication for the Government not to
rely on its statutory advisors.

14

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

We support the recommendations of the Responsible Gambling Strategy
Board for the principles which should apply to the successor
arrangements to the tripartite agreement as laid out in its 2011 Strategy
document. In addition, the advice from the Responsible Gambling
Strategy Board regarding the amount required for future research,
education and treatment, if accepted, must be clearly communicated to
the gambling industry. This advice should set out how the money
donated by the industry will be spent. We await with interest proposals
from the Gambling Commission for a replacement for the now defunct
system for funding and commissioning research, education and
treatment programmes. (Paragraph 92)
38. The Government welcomes the Committee’s support of the principles of the
new arrangements as set out by the RGSB. Its strategy, published on 3
December 2012, reiterated the need for funding and the research,
education and treatment programmes which are necessary to tackle
gambling-related harm. In implementing that strategy, the RGT has started
and will continue to articulate to its donors the importance of its funded
work and explain how the money is being spent. In addition, the RGSB’s
Treatment Expert Panel recommends mechanisms that the RGT could
adopt to improve value for money.
The Gambling Commission should make an assessment of the available
gambling education programmes aimed at under 16 year olds—including
that which has been developed by GamCare—and make a
recommendation on their merits, based on projected cost and level of
impact. (Paragraph 96)
39. The Government agrees with the Committee on the need to assess
whether gambling education programmes for under 16 year olds are
effective. The Gambling Commission has previously sought the RGSB’s
advice on the proposal to include gambling within the Personal, Social and
Health Education (PSHE) curriculum. Their advice indicated that the
available evidence base did not provide a clear rationale for committing
limited resources to its inclusion in the curriculum. Indeed, some
international experience suggests that there is potential for curriculumbased education programmes to be counterproductive.
40. However, the RGSB’s strategy for 2013/14 to 2015/16 will identify as a
priority plans to build on the work done here and overseas to develop more
effective ways of preventing gambling-related harm amongst young people
– whether that be curriculum-based education or other methods.

The Industry, Tax and Regulation
We recognise that the Bingo sector remains highly taxed in comparison
with other sectors despite its status as one of the softest forms of
gambling. In principle we believe that bingo should be taxed in line with
other forms of gambling at 15%.
Moreover, we recommend that the Treasury make an assessment, within
the next financial year, of the likelihood that a reduction in bingo duty, to
15%, would result in increased investment in the bingo sector and a rise
in net tax take. (Paragraph 104)
41. The rate of bingo duty was set by the previous Government. When it comes
into effect in February 2013, the standard rate of Machine Games Duty
(MGD) of 20% will be the same as the rate of bingo duty.
42. The Government keeps all taxes under review and currently estimates that
a reduction in the rate of bingo duty to 15% would cost the Exchequer
approximately £30 million per annum.
43. The Government continues to actively engage with the bingo industry as
part of the usual budget process. Ministers and officials have met with
representatives of the industry, and consider all representations received
on the impact of duty changes on the industry.
We are not convinced by arguments from the Treasury that measures to
allow the offsetting of Gross Profits Tax against VAT on capital
investment for gambling machines cannot currently be implemented.
The Treasury should carry out further work in this area and identify a
means by which such offsetting could be achieved.
We also recommend that the Treasury make judicious use of industry
analysis of the likely impacts of its proposed taxation measures. As it is
in the public interest to maximise the tax take from the gambling
industry, the Treasury should set tax at a level which allows investment
in the industry and does not stifle growth. We recommend that the
Treasury also take into account the likely impact on investment by the
gambling industry in future tax-rate calculations. We recommend that
any changes to machine gaming duty should be revenue neutral as the
Economic Secretary to the Treasury assured us that they would be. If the
rate of machine gaming duty raises more than a revenue neutral figure,
the Chancellor should reduce the new rate to ensure that revenue
neutrality is achieved. (Paragraph 109)
44. The Government decided not to adopt the proposal to allow businesses to
offset otherwise irrecoverable VAT against MGD liabilities. Doing so would

16

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

complicate the legislation for MGD, and increase administrative burdens.
Recoverable input VAT was taken into account by the Government when
MGD rates were set. If that had not been done, MGD rates would have
been set at higher levels.
45. The rates of MGD have been set in a way which is intended to achieve
revenue neutrality for the Exchequer, based on a thorough analysis of all
the available evidence, including industry analysis. The policy costings
document published alongside the Budget outlines how rates have been
calculated. The costings have been independently scrutinised by the Office
of Budget Responsibility. The Government has also published a technical
note describing the data and methodology used to calculate the lower and
standard rates of MGD in greater detail.
46. The data used in HMRC’s modelling has been collected from many
sources. Data from the Gambling Commission underpin many of the inputs,
where necessary corroborated by and adjusted for other sources of
information, including consultation responses.
To give certainty to online operators, and their investment plans, we
urge the Government to adhere to its timetable for implementation by
December, 2014 and to make plans to deal with any challenges to the
proposed new system. However, the Treasury still needs to work with
industry stakeholders to establish the correct level for online gambling
taxation, taking into account the need to encourage companies to
accept UK regulation and taxation and to discourage the formation of a
grey market. (Paragraph 117)
47. A place of consumption basis of taxation will level the playing field in terms
of UK duty liability and provide a fairer basis for competition between
remote gambling operators based in the UK and overseas. It will further
enhance the competitiveness of the UK tax system by excluding from the
scope of tax any profits from transactions with non-UK customers. The
reform will also help improve the sustainability of the UK’s tax base by
ensuring that remote gambling, alongside other gambling products, makes
a fair contribution to public finances.
48. A consultation on policy design for the place of consumption tax reforms
closed in June 2012, and the responses received are being analysed. The
Government will continue to work with the industry to consider their
concerns ahead of the implementation of the reforms.
Regulation and the Impact of the Act
We welcome the reinstatement of the Triennial Review system for
gambling machine stakes and prizes. These reviews should be designed

17

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

to maintain the value in real terms of stakes and prizes, as is the case
with other industries where prices are controlled by the Government,
rather than as a means of increasing industry profitability. A Triennial
Review system has the potential to lead to significant calls from all
sectors of the industry that they should have their machine allowances
and/or stakes and prizes increased on a regular basis. It is important
therefore that these reviews are carried out on the basis of evidence, are
as open and depoliticised as possible. (Paragraph 124)
49. The Government welcomes the Committee’s support for the Triennial
Review system. We agree that all reviews should be carried out on a solid
evidence base and as a fully open and transparent process. A periodic
review will allow the Government to take into account and act on the
research as outlined by the RGSB and taken forward by the RGT. This
includes considering reductions in stake and prize limits should any causal
links found between machine characteristics and problem gambling.
50. However, the Government also agrees with the Gambling Commission that
in the longer term there might be better ways to regulate stakes and prizes
for gaming machines than simply using blanket controls such as centrally
set limits on stakes and prizes. Therefore, the review process will also look
at new technologies across the industry and the scope they may offer to
enable more effectively and efficiently targeted regulation.
We consider that a vital aspect of gambling regulation is controlling the
significant, and growing, online sector with its unlimited stakes and
prizes, and its potential to cause problem gambling. The Commission’s
plans for licensing online operators will rely heavily on other regulators
which the Commission has very limited means of monitoring. The
Commission should aim to improve its links with overseas regulators for
the purpose of spreading best-practice in terms of customer protection
and problem gambling prevention. (Paragraph 133)
We recommend that the Gambling Commission should consider, as a
part of efforts to communicate to online gamblers the potential risks to
their funds, introducing a kite-marking system for gambling websites,
indicating which sites are regulated in the UK. This could protect
consumers by encouraging them to use UK-regulated sites and by
incentivising suppliers to choose to be regulated here. (Paragraph 138)
In the light of the Full Tilt case, however, the Gambling Commission
should consult the industry as to what form of ‘ring fencing’ or
protection of player accounts, by all UK-regulated online gambling
operators, would be a proportionate response to the worries arising
from this unfortunate episode. (Paragraph 139)

18

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

It is therefore important that effective enforcement methods are put in
place to prevent unlicensed companies from operating into the UK and
that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and other agencies
also work to encourage international co-operation and a common
approach. (Paragraph 151)
It is vital for the Government to recognise that the success of any new
regulatory regime for online gambling will rest on the development and
implementation of effective enforcement mechanisms for regulation. The
Government’s proposals for the regulation of remote gambling remain
very unclear particularly with regard to how the Gambling Commission
intends either to approve and monitor regulators in other jurisdictions or
to directly regulate and licence all the individual companies which
operate in the UK. It is not currently clear whether the Gambling
Commission intends to carry out licensing checks on all companies that
apply to operate in the UK. We recognise that it would be unrealistic for
the Commission to inspect directly individual regulators across all other
jurisdictions. We recommend that the Commission should approve
certain overseas regulators and continue to monitor their performance
where they meet its requirements. The Commission should undertake
test purchasing exercises to ensure that these national regulators
continue to carry out sufficient licensing checks. Such an approach
would have the merit of encouraging international co-operation leading,
in due course, to a more harmonised, consistent and less bureaucratic
regulatory system across the 27 member states. For the sake of
confidence and market knowledge, the Gambling Commission should
also test whether regulators it has not yet approved carry out sufficient
licensing checks. (Paragraph 154)
51. The Government agrees with the Committee that there should be an
effective enforcement mechanism for regulating online gambling, and will
work closely with the Gambling Commission to ensure this is the case. The
Government believes, however, that comparisons between restrictions in
stakes and prizes in terrestrial gambling outlets and the absence of such
limits online miss an important point. In the online environment, accountbased play is ubiquitous. That enables much more sophisticated and
powerful tools to manage, for example, underage access, money
laundering and problem gambling, than is generally the case in terrestrial
environments where the player is usually anonymous and the play is cash
rather than account based.
52. The ability to “capture every click” online has the potential to provide, from
the regulator’s point of view, a highly accurate and accessible audit trail for
regulatory purposes. The Government and the Gambling Commission
believe there is an alternative argument that, if the terrestrial industry were
able to replicate the targeted controls that account-based play and

19

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

electronic payment offers, there may be more scope for it to develop in the
ways it would like to see. However, it is acknowledged that there is a strong
bias towards the concept of anonymity in terrestrial gambling in Great
Britain and that it is a principle that some sectors of the industry have
fought hard to preserve.
53. The Government has published draft legislation (available at
http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm84/8497/8497.asp)
which would oblige all gambling operators selling into the British market –
whether based in Great Britain or abroad – to obtain a licence from the
Gambling Commission. The reforms would ensure consistency in terms of
public protection. We hope to introduce the Bill as soon as the legislative
timetable allows.
54. We are clear that the proposals will not duplicate the work of other
regulators or unnecessarily increase burdens imposed on operators.
Rather, the proposed system will avoid duplication by relying on the
information provided to, and testing already undertaken for, other
regulators, subject to sufficient on-going assurance of quality and rigour.
The Gambling Commission has been very active in European and
international regulatory bodies in sharing knowledge and promoting
appropriate collaboration. However, the proposed licensing requirement will
provide an important safeguard that would allow the Commission to
intervene directly where problems occur which are not sufficiently dealt with
by other regulators. This is the approach the Government has consistently
adopted in discussions in Europe and represents the model we hope other
European jurisdictions, who are opening up their own gambling markets,
will adopt.
55. Under current Gambling Commission requirements, operators are required
to state on their website that they are regulated by the Commission and
provide a link to its website, where information is available to help the
consumer and provide further signposting where appropriate. However, the
Government notes the Committee’s recommendation that further emphasis
is placed on the information made available to the consumer about where
gambling is regulated and the Commission will consider this issue further
as it implements the planned changes to regulation of remote gambling.
56. The Government notes the helpful suggestions from the Committee about
the regulation and enforcement of the new regime and looks forward to
receiving the Committee’s comments on the draft Bill and accompanying
documentation.
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport should make clear how the
Gambling Commission will assess the effectiveness of other national
regulators and what the Commission will require of its agents. Any

20

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

additional regulatory activities will have resource implications which the
Gambling Commission will have to address within its existing budget.
(Paragraph 155)
Given that most UK operators have located their online operations
offshore, this inquiry has heard concerns regarding the expertise of the
Gambling Commission to monitor effectively a much larger number of
online licence holders under the proposed changes to the regulatory
regime. The Commission will, therefore, need to bolster its capability to
do so, from within existing resources, as supplemented by licence
income from the online operators it approves. (Paragraph 156)
57. The Gambling Commission will determine whether businesses are suitable
to obtain or continue to hold a licence in Great Britain. However, the
Government and the Gambling Commission have made clear that it would
not be proportionate to duplicate enquiries or investigations already carried
out elsewhere; the Commission will therefore use information provided by
other regulators where that information is available, up to date and relevant.
58. The Gambling Commission is actively engaged bilaterally with overseas
regulators to better understand the possible information available; for
example, with the regulatory forums of Gaming Regulators European
Forum and the International Association of Gaming Regulators to explore
areas for reducing duplication of regulation. However, the Commission’s
focus under the remote reforms will be on the suitability of operators, not
jurisdictions, and the white-list will be phased out.
59. The Gambling Commission will be consulting on the appropriate measures
that can be required of operators to protect customer funds against fraud or
insolvency and to communicate any potential risks to customers. This may
lead to amendments to the licence conditions and codes of practice.
Casinos
The Government should reconsider its plans to test the impact of the
new casinos. Given that casinos have some of the most comprehensive
measures for tackling problem gambling and in the light of some of our
other recommendations we believe that casino operators will already be
doing enough to enable the industry to grow safely. (Paragraph 163)
60. The Government will continue to work with the sixteen local authorities
permitted to award the new licences and with the Gambling Commission
and operators to determine when enough local data might be available to
inform policy decisions in this area

21

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

61. The new types of premises permitted by the Gambling Act, especially large
casinos, are on a far larger scale than existing casino premises with a view
to providing a wider range of gambling facilities. This includes a much more
liberal gaming machine allowance. It would be wrong for the Government to
roll out these licences more widely until it has a better understanding of the
potential effect of these new premises on communities, both economically
and socially, as well as some firm support from local authorities for casino
developments in their area.
The Government should review the licensing process for Small and
Large Casinos with a view to developing a new simplified and less
expensive licensing process. (Paragraph 164)
62. The Government agrees with the Committee that the licensing process for
small and large casinos has proved to be complicated and time consuming.
Once there is a better understanding of how these new types of premises
might impact on local areas, then the Government will consider its next
steps. Should the evidence suggest that simplification is possible then we
would consider a range of factors, including the best way to award any new
licences.
We believe that the decision as to whether a casino would be of benefit
to a local area should be made by local authorities rather than central
diktat. We recommend that any local authority be able to make the
decision as to whether or not they want a casino. As a step towards this,
we recommend that existing 1968 Act Casino licences are made
portable, allowing operators to relocate to any local authority provided
that they have the consent of that local authority. The portability of these
licences would be constrained by the existing 'triple lock' contained in
the Gambling Act: the need to obtain local authority approval, a
premises licence and planning permission. (Paragraph 165)
63. The Government welcomes the Committee’s contribution to this issue. The
casino industry has already approached the Government with a proposal to
relax restrictions on the locations of casinos operating under a converted
casino premises licence. Such a proposal is not uncontroversial and any
case for change would have to have support locally. The industry must
engage constructively with local government to secure local agreement to
any proposals it might put forward to advance its objectives. The
Government will support such engagement, although any agreed approach
should not be detrimental to the work already being undertaken by the
sixteen local authorities permitted to award new licences or risk
destabilising the competitive balance across the casino sector.
We note that not one Small Casino has been developed. It was not
Parliament’s intention in 2005 to make Small Casinos completely

22

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

unviable. Given the fact that all casinos are highly regulated and access
is limited regardless of the size, we see no rationale for the different
gaming machine allowance. As 5:1 is the ratio presently in the
legislation, we recommend that the Government introduce a single ratio
of five machines to one table for both Small and Large Casinos. Local
authorities should have the power to increase the number of machines
permitted per table if they wish to do so and an operator requests it.
(Paragraph 169)
64. Local authority competitions to award the new casino licences are currently
underway. Changing the gaming machine to gaming table ratio for small
casinos at this stage would undermine that process as it would significantly
alter the basis on which operators have prepared bids. Once there is clarity
about the number of new licences that will be awarded and developed, plus
a better understanding of the potential impact of new casinos on
communities, the Government will consider whether there is a case to roll
out the new types of premises more widely. A range of factors would have
to be considered, including evidence about the economic viability of the
different types of licence, as well as demand from local authorities to issue
casino licences.
There is currently no way of assessing what impact allowing 1968 Act
Casinos the same freedoms would have. In principle, we see no logical
reason for maintaining different regulatory regimes and believe that 1968
Act Casinos should be given the same freedoms as new ones.
Paragraph 172)
65. The Government does recognise that the lack of evidence about the impact
of Gambling Act casinos may be restricting the market and potential
investment. Over the coming months, officials will work with the industry
and local authorities to identify what steps need to be taken to reach a point
where a case could be presented to Ministers to allow them to make an
informed decision, consulting the Gambling Commission as necessary.
This does not mean that the Government supports the case for
harmonisation at this stage, but does signal that we are willing to look at the
evidence.
We conclude therefore, that the opportunity to establish one or more
Regional Casinos in the UK has passed and, without a change in the
political and economic climate, is unlikely to reoccur. (Paragraph 183)
66. The Government agrees with the Committee’s view that a Regional Casino
is not something the industry sees as a priority. We have no plans to revisit
the issue.

23

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

The Gambling Commission
The Gambling Commission needs to provide greater clarity about what it
means by moving away from a blanket stake and prize regime. We are
concerned that a move towards allowing individual venues or operators
to have stakes and prizes set at a different level to the rest of the
market—because the Gambling Commission considers that they are well
controlled—could destabilise the regulatory pyramid. (Paragraph 197)
67. Gaming machine regulation currently takes the form of controls on stake
and prize limits, technical standards, and restrictions on the numbers of
machines that may be sited in various types of gambling establishment
(although with no overall limit on the total numbers available in the
community). These methods of control have to date been the best available
to governments and regulators. However, these controls could be seen to
be blunt tools which restrict innovation, constrain consumer experience and
hamper the ability of policy makers and regulators to make real progress on
problem gambling.
68. The Gambling Commission is working with the RGSB Machines Experts
Group and the industry to explore whether it would be more effective to
tailor harm-prevention measures to the individual player, either alone or
alongside traditional controls such as stake and prize limits. These
measures, which would target those at risk, may be possible due to
technological developments and could range from increased provision of
information to players about their play to more sophisticated player tracking
systems to identify potentially problematic behaviour. Behaviour such as
chasing losses could trigger customer intervention, whether in person, or
the automatic provision of information to players about their current play
session.
69. The Government and the Gambling Commission are clear that any
changes in this area must be made on the basis of evidence. Any
movement towards greater scope for innovation will depend heavily on
industry’s commitment to identify and implement much better harm
minimisation measures. The Commission is monitoring developments and
research in these areas domestically and internationally, and possible
harm-prevention measures are a priority within the RGSB’s strategy for
2013/14 to 2015/16.
We recommend that the Gambling Commission provide the gambling
industry with a clear and easily accessible summary of where the fees it
charges are spent as a part of its Annual Report (Paragraph 202)

24

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

70. The Government agrees with the Committee that the Gambling
Commission must be transparent about its fees and costs. For the first time
this year, the Commission is distributing a short, clear and accessible
annual summary of where licence fees are spent to operators at the time
their annual fee payment falls due. It is looking at ways to more openly
publicise the extent and purpose of routine licensing, compliance and
enforcement activity to licence holders. Fee levels are kept under review
and there is a full consultation process setting out the cost basis for fees
whenever changes are proposed. These measures are consistent with the
Chancellor of the Exchequer’s announcement as part of the Autumn
Statement that regulators will be asked to bear down on costs and be more
transparent about how fees levels are established. We will explore with the
Commission whether it can do more in this area as a result of the
Chancellor’s statement.
The Commission should introduce a new licence fee structure which
gives a much clearer reflection of the amounts charged per shop. Small
independent operators should certainly be paying less than they are
now. The Commission should also be looking to charge large operators
less than they currently are. (Paragraph 203)
71. The Government is pleased to receive the Committee’s views on this
subject and glad that the report acknowledges the work the Gambling
Commission has done to engage with the industry in this area.
72. The Gambling Commission regulates the licensed operating entity, not the
premises from which gambling is offered, There are large economies of
scale available to them when dealing with larger operators that it must take
advantage of, and reflect in its fees structure. The Commission must
therefore decide where the delineation between fee bands should most
appropriately fall, based on its assessment of such economies.
73. Fees are made up of the need to recover two sorts of costs: those which do
not directly vary with the size of the operator, such as premises visits,
where there are high economies of scale where premises can be sampled;
and thematic costs which are not directly related to costs of regulating
individual licensed entities, but are costs that need to be recovered from
operators equitably such as tackling illegal machine supply, and providing
advice to Government. The Gambling Commission therefore uses fee
bands (grouping operators by the number of premises they have as the
best proxy measure of the impact of gambling currently available) to ensure
that the fees relate as closely as possible to the compliance costs
associated with them.
74. In recommending fee bands to Ministers, the Gambling Commission does
carefully consider the dynamics of each industry sector and the cost of

25

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

regulating differing types and sizes of operator using a proportionate riskbased approach. The Commission recognises that there will be individual
operators who will face rises in their fees when they move between fee
bands. To mitigate this effect, the Commission has demonstrated its
willingness to work with operators who face a band-related increase in fees
by, for example, being willing to licence parts of the business as separate
legal entities if that proved cheaper than a single licence covering the whole
business.
We consider that the Commission has not gone far enough, in
particular, in its efforts to reduce its operating costs. We recommend
that an independent review of Gambling Commission expenditure be
carried out as soon as possible after a new system for remote
licensing is in place. We consider that it is important for such a review
to be carried out externally so that the industry has confidence in its
conclusions. The reviewing body should have the power to
recommend changes to the Commission with a view to reducing its
costs and the regulatory and fees burden imposed on the industry
taking into account the Commission’s ability to fulfil its licensing
objectives. (Paragraph 204)
75. The Government notes with interest the Committee’s views and will
consider further following the introduction of the new system for remote
licensing. The Government agrees that it is important the costs of
regulation are appropriately assessed. That is why fee proposals are
already subject to extensive consultation with stakeholders and
independent scrutiny by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the
Regulatory Policy Committee and by Parliament.
76. With the 2011/12 review of its licence fees, the Gambling Commission had
initially intended to maintain the overall fee burden at the levels that were
set in cash terms in 2009, which would have represented a reduction in real
terms of around 7%. In light of the responses received to that consultation
on fees, and its continuing efforts to reduce cost and improve efficiency, the
Commission implemented further fee reductions which enabled it to reduce
its overall fee burden by around £715,000 compared to 2009 levels for the
fiscal year 2012/13. This is a reduction of approximately 5% of the overall
Gambling Commission budget. Of approximately 3,850 operators licensed
by the Gambling Commission, only 33 of those operators were subject to
fees increases. In many of those cases the bulk of the fee increase
stemmed from a more equitable distribution of costs between operators in
that sector. Around 45% of licensees were subject to fees decreases of
some level (including the smaller betting, bingo and arcade operators and
remote society lotteries that benefited from the new ancillary licence) and
fees for the remaining 2,100 operators were unchanged from 2009 levels,
i.e. a reduction in real terms.

26

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

Whilst we believe that the Gambling Commission’s primary objectives,
and its ability to maintain a good relationship with all gambling
stakeholders, are best served by it remaining as an impartial regulator,
there is no such barrier to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
having a more supportive role towards the industry. Despite the
statement, displayed on the website for the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport, that it is a sponsor for the gambling industry, it makes
no mention of the gambling industry in its Departmental Business Plan
of 2011/15. We call on the Government clearly to set out its position on
whether the gambling industry constitutes a legitimate mainstream
leisure pursuit and whether it intends to be a pro-active sponsor of, or
simply to tolerate, the UK gambling industry. (Paragraph 208)
77. The Government agrees with the Committee’s conclusion about the
importance of the Gambling Commission remaining an independent
regulator which should not have a role in promoting the gambling industry.
78. While gambling is not specifically mentioned in the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport’s high level business plan, it is part of our contribution to
creating the conditions for growth through reducing and reforming
regulations which impact on sport, recreation and leisure.
During this inquiry we have found the Gambling Commission’s website,
which should be a significant tool for communication, frustrating. This
should not be the case with a modern regulator and we recommend that
the Commission move quickly to rectify any technical or design issues
which prevent its website from being an effective communication tool.
Specifically, the Gambling Commission should ensure that the search
engine built into its website is functional and that links are maintained.
(Paragraph 212)
79. This is a matter for the Gambling Commission which actively seeks
feedback on the usefulness of its website and other forms of
communications. The Commission has plans to provide cost-effective
improvements and has already implemented changes to its website to
make content searches easier, including a quick links page featuring the
top three destination pages for each sector and removing a number of
pages to reduce the number of clicks users have to make to get to the
information required. The effectiveness of these changes is being closely
monitored through user analysis and direct consumer feedback.
80. The Commission has also made changes to some of the terminology used
throughout the site, such as inclusion of terms like ‘online’ alongside
‘remote’, ‘raffles’ alongside ‘lotteries’ and ‘fruit machines’ alongside ‘gaming
machines.

27

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

The Gambling Commission needs to continue to make improvements in
the way it communicates with the businesses it regulates, particularly
when conveying the reasons behind its regulatory activity. In particular,
it should ensure that the purpose of requests for data are made clear.
(Paragraph 214)
81. The Government agrees with the Committee that the Gambling
Commission’s purpose for data collection should be transparent and
focussed. The Commission itself recognises that improvements in its
communications with stakeholders can always be made. This is why their
2012/13 Business Plan includes a programme to improve understanding of
the regulatory framework and the Commission’s role and risk-based
approach.
82. The information the Gambling Commission collects from operators is used
to help assess the risk posed by operators, as part of the compliance
programme. In addition, the Government relies strongly on the data
collected from the industry from regulatory returns to inform policy
decisions. The Commission also provides the industry with data from the
returns in the form of the annual industry statistics publication, as well as
providing specific provisional figures throughout the year. These figures are
widely used by the industry, media and other stakeholders.
83. However, the Gambling Commission recognises the importance of ensuring
all data requests from the industry remain tied to specific regulatory
requirements or fulfil its role as advisor to the Government on gambling. It
will therefore continue to strive to explain the rationale for collecting,
analysing and publicising key regulatory data.
The Commission should provide clear, accessible guidance to operators
and local authorities, setting out its regulatory responsibilities and those
of the local authorities. This would help to avoid regulatory and
enforcement activity falling between the two responsible bodies.
(Paragraph 218)
84. The Government agrees with the Committee that good lines of
communication between the Gambling Commission and Local Authorities
are important if the Gambling Act is to function properly. We welcome the
creation of the Commission’s Local Authority Liaison Unit, which works
closely with local councils. Feedback to the Commission from local
authorities and the industry suggests that the Unit is being seen as a
valuable resource.
85. Since the Committee’s report was published, the Commission has released
the 4th edition of the Guidance to Licensing Authorities (September 2012) to

28

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

take account of emerging themes and clarify any areas of uncertainty. The
Guidance is supplemented by a range of publications, as well as day-to-day
technical support and cooperation.
The Government and both Commissions should clarify what effect the
planned merger of the Gambling Commission and the National Lottery
Commission will have on the objectives, regulatory policies and
practices of the resulting unified regulator, in particular the newly
merged regulator’s approach to society and charitable lotteries and the
National Lottery. (Paragraph 222)
86. The Government can confirm that any merged body will retain the existing
statutory duties of the Gambling Commission and the National Lottery
Commission. The regulation of the gambling industry and the National
Lottery operator will not be amended as a result of the merger.
87. It will be a matter for the Government and Parliament, advised as
necessary by the relevant regulator, to determine whether there should be
any changes to the existing legislation governing society lotteries or the
National Lottery.
The Gambling Commission should continue to effect cost-saving
measures as a part of its merger with the National Lottery Commission
wherever these would not interfere with its statutory objectives.
(Paragraph 225)
88. The Government agrees that the co-location of the National Lottery
Commission and the Gambling Commission has been an opportunity to
deliver important cost-savings. We are currently considering responses to a
consultation which ran to 23 October 2012 on the plans to implement the
provisions for the merger (as set out in the Public Bodies Bill which
received Royal Assent in December 2011). The impact assessment for the
consultation set out the cost-savings which have already been implemented
and the estimated proposed cost-savings over time. The merged body will
continue to seek cost-savings where possible.
The Government should provide clarity one way or the other as to what
constitutes a national lottery and what constitutes a local lottery
connected to other local lotteries. If the Government decides to allow
more than one national lottery then it should ensure fair competition by
requiring any new national lottery provider to pay lottery duty and meet
the same legal requirements as the existing National Lottery operator.
(Paragraph 230)
89. The Government believes that the key aim of legislation relating to the
National Lottery and society lotteries should be to ensure the efficient and

29

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

effective generation of valuable resources for charities, voluntary
organisations and other good causes. We have been looking at the current
regulation in light of recent developments in the society lottery market and
have announced our intention to consult on possible changes to the
minimum percentage of income that society lotteries are required to pass
onto their good causes.
We recommend the immediate and practical solution of making ancillary
remote licences free of charge for small society lotteries. This would not,
however, have any effect on the amount of bureaucracy involved in
small lotteries making licence applications and renewals. (Paragraph
233)
90. The Government agrees that the fees for society lotteries which sell tickets
by both remote and non-remote means should be proportionate and in line
with the compliance costs associated with the additional work by the
Gambling Commission. With the introduction of the ancillary remote
operating licence for society lotteries in April 2012 (which attracts an annual
fee of £50), the fees for around 150 societies were reduced. Of these 150
societies, the fee reduction for small lotteries is at least £280 per annum. In
some instances for medium sized lotteries, the ancillary licence allowed
fees to be reduced by over £600.
91. The Government is pleased to see the introduction of this more
proportionate cost for ancillary lottery licences. It would not be appropriate
for the annual fee for this particular ancillary licence to be reduced to zero,
because there are compliance costs associated with the licence. The
society lottery ancillary remote operating licence allows tickets to be sold by
any means of communication, and allows lottery proceeds up to £250,000
per annum, which could exceed the proceeds of the non-remote licence2.
We recommend that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport work
with local licensing authorities to review the registration process for
small society and charity lotteries with a view to reducing their
administrative burdens. (Paragraph 233)
92. The Government agrees that the current process of registration for small
lotteries and raffles should be reviewed and is considering this area as part
of its response to the Red Tape Challenge.
We recommend that the Government should establish whether there is
evidence that the National Lottery would be adversely affected by
society lotteries with the right to offer increased or unlimited prizes. If it
2

All other ancillary licences are more restricted in the means of remote communication which is
permitted, and on the proportion of proceeds which may come from non-remote means.

30

Department for Culture, Media and Sport

cannot be demonstrated that the current limits on small lotteries are
necessary to protect the National Lottery from competition, then they
should be reduced or removed. If the limits on small lotteries are
removed then they should be subject to lottery duty on the same basis
as the National Lottery. (Paragraph 235)
93. The Government agrees that it is important to understand the impact of a
developing society lottery sector on the National Lottery. Research was
commissioned in 2012 on the impact of the Health Lottery and similar types
of lottery are having/would have on the National Lottery. As noted above,
the Government intends to consult on possible changes to the proportion of
income that society lotteries are required to pass on to their good causes.
