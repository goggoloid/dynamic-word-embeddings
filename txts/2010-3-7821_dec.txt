The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Introduction: “A vision for Public Libraries”
by Margaret Hodge, Minister for Culture
I launched the Public Library Consultation in December and throughout the past few
months, and indeed before, I have been struck by the passion and sincerity of those who
have contributed. The dedication and inventiveness of many leaders of the library
service is impressive, and the zeal of local users is second to none, a testament to the
value bestowed on public libraries. I, too, am convinced of the great significance and
impact of the work of the public library service; the vigour and willingness of its staff,
the overwhelming public support for its place in community life and the genuinely life
transforming potential of its impact.
Public libraries are a democratic entitlement for every individual, for every community
and for the whole nation. To echo the American Library Association I believe the public
library service is a unique institution, that “guards against the tyrannies of ignorance
and conformity, and its existence indicates the extent to which a democratic society
values knowledge, truth, justice, books, and culture1”. For many people, libraries are a
haven of hope, a gateway to knowledge and learning, and an opportunity to access
information and to participate as a citizen. With more branches than McDonalds or
Boots, and more visits to libraries than shoppers in London’s West End, the public
library network is a triumph of infrastructure and branding2. Our libraries are the
keepers of a national book collection which reflects our shared learning and chronicles
our intellectual and cultural environment.
We have seen some significant investment in public libraries over the last 10 years:
£120m National Lottery Funds were invested in the People’s Network, delivered by the
Museums, Libraries & Archives Council (MLA), to provide broadband internet access and
staff IT training in every library in the UK3; the Big Lottery Fund awarded £80m
investment across 58 local authorities to invigorate libraries as centres of wider
community activity and engage local people in plans to build or refurbish libraries. The
MLA have secured investment into a range of initiatives such as Boys into Books, Book
Ahead and the Festival of Learning. Partnership programmes between libraries and third
sector partners like The Reading Agency (TRA), the National Literacy Trust and Booktrust
have been instrumental in growing readership especially among young people. The
number of library led reading groups nearly trebled to 10,000 between 2004 and 2008,
and 100,000 people now belong to a group.4

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

But, as every good librarian knows, public libraries are not about sitting back and passively
waiting for people to borrow your books – they are about active engagement with the
community, making links to other public services, and responding to the policy imperatives
of the day. Where that happens there is evidence of their transformative impact.
I want all national and local government departments to recognise the key role that
public libraries can and do play in our priority policies – for instance, in helping people
get online, improving literacy, providing services for families, helping people look for
jobs, building community cohesion and libraries’ flexible role in signposting all sorts of
public initiatives and services. Research commissioned by DCMS and the Evidence
Reference group for this review suggests that public libraries can support parenting, the
development of speech and early communication skills in children, and of course, the
enjoyment of reading and child literacy5.
I believe that the vision for public libraries set out in Framework for the Future6 still holds
true today and their role continues to be to provide books, learning, information and
entertainment to customers, to provide a centre for communities and to provide an
education resource7.
However, the context in which libraries operate is changing starkly and at speed. In our
December consultation document we set out five challenges for Public Libraries8:
• How can we reverse the current trend of decline in library usage and grow the
numbers using the library service?
• How can the library service respond to limited public resource and economic
pressures?
• How can all libraries respond to a 24/7 culture and to changing expectations of people
who want immediate access to information?
• How can all libraries grasp the opportunities presented by digitisation?
• How can the library service demonstrate to citizens, commentators and politicians
that they are still relevant and vital?
We received 154 consultation responses, 68 of which were from local government or
library authorities, 43 were from companies or organisations (including 9 from library
campaign groups) and 43 were from individuals. An additional 15 people commented on
the RightToReply website and 28 essays were included in the consultation document,
approximately 80 people attended reference groups, round tables or Project Board
meetings. DCMS ministers and officials have discussed our vision at over 30 meetings
with stakeholders and spoken at a number of high profile events.
This consultation exercise has endorsed those five challenges, with a number of
submissions responding to the challenges rather than individual questions.
It is also clear that there is a collective acceptance of a sixth challenge: the variety in
the quality of the library service across the country. Replicating themes from Framework
for the Future, there continues to be recognition that, although there are many examples
of innovative, world class services, there are parts of the service which are not

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

performing effectively and best practice is not easily shared across the 151 library
authorities, 3,500 libraries or the 21,000 people who work in the service.
This document aims to build on Framework for the Future, by communicating and
maximising the work of public libraries, and supporting the service to respond to those
six challenges with confidence. I want to set a collective challenge for all libraries to
become as innovative and imaginative as the best so that the service remains cherished
and valued by all and continues to be a lynchpin in local communities in the 21st
century.
I am grateful to the many individuals and organisations who have responded to
questions, attended meetings and events, and provided views, perspectives and
information to this process. I would particularly like to thank staff at the MLA, the
Review’s Project Board and Reference Groups and the Advisory Council on Libraries who
have given generously of their ideas and experience.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Summary of Proposals
Chapter 1 – Aim: to drive the quality of all library services up to the level of
the best
1: A Library Offer to the Public: The Government recommends a Library Offer to the
public for all public libraries in England. The Library Offer will be made up of a ‘core
offer’ of services which all library services should deliver and a ‘local offer’ of services,
shaped and delivered at local level.
A core offer for all libraries: Government recommends that the core offer for all libraries
should include the following provisions to be made available across all library authorities:
• Library membership from birth: Details of local schemes to ensure that library
membership is available from the earliest point in a child’s life (The Government
expects that from April 2011 all local authorities ensure that library membership is an
entitlement to children from birth. More detail in proposal 8)
• An opportunity to have your say and get involved in shaping the service (local
details to be set out)
• Free access to a range and quality of book stock to browse and borrow and
online resources and information that meet local needs (including e-books as the
market grows)
• Access to the national book collection – any book from anywhere: Order any book
through your library (even out of print books)
• Free Internet access for all: Computers and access to online information and
communication. (The Government will change legislation to prevent library authorities
charging for internet access from April 2011. Further details set out in proposal 27)
• Help to get online: Support for people using the internet for the first time or
searching for information
• Links to other public services and opportunities: Connections to health, education
and learning or employment opportunities (local details to be set out)
• A Community of Readers: Connecting people to other readers through reading
groups, activities and recommendations
• Flexible opening hours to suit the needs of the local people (local details to be set out)
• Commitment to customer service and expert, helpful staff
• A safe local space which is accessible and convenient for the community
• 24 hour access: Through your library’s online catalogue, online reference and other
services. Website details to be set out
• Services which reach out and attract local people (local details to be set out
including ‘at home’ services to housebound people)
• An opportunity to be a member of all libraries in England: Easy to join, accessible
services as announced by the Society of Chief Librarians (SCL)9

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

The Government believes that these services represent the core offer which should be
provided across all library authorities in England. Most library authorities are already
providing this core service in full but Government recommends that all libraries provide
a universal core offer.
A local offer for libraries: As part of the local element of the Library Offer to the
public, library authorities can shape their offer around local need but might consider
including:
• Commitments on book stock variety, investment and procurement
• Opportunities and activities for young people as part of the local provision of
positive activities
• Provisions for learning such as improving reading and writing skills, and partnerships
with local schools, early years settings and children’s centres
• An Events programme including training events or activities for readers and author
visits
• Family activities: Family reading and learning activities – Bookstart Rhymetime
homework clubs, links to family information services, holiday reading challenges.
• Programmes of engagement with the community including outreach initiatives and
ways of encouraging wider usage, including families
• Details of how to get involved with user groups, supporting or influencing the library
service
• Spaces for community use
• Childcare or crèche
• Additional Services like CD and DVD borrowing, a book delivery service, coffee shops etc
Other ideas are included throughout this document.
Next steps: Government recommends that library authorities finalise their Library Offer
to the public by the end of 2010. Government will review the Library Offer after two
years and consider whether to legislate to make it a statutory obligation.
2. Guidance on process of engagement and consultation: Sitting alongside the
Library Offer to the public, the questions set out below are issued here as best practice
guidance on the processes which Government recommends library authorities consider
under their statutory duty. Government will review the best practice guidance set out
here after two years and consider whether to legislate to make the guidance statutory.
Q1 What resources are available and how does this match the needs of the
community?
• Have you analysed and considered need and demand? What are the specific needs of
adults, families and young people of all ages? Would members of the community be
able and willing to contribute to the delivery of library services as volunteers or
joint managers?
• What are the needs of those living, working and studying in the area?
• How accessible is the service? Is public transport appropriate? Are there barriers to
physical access of library buildings that should be removed?
• Have local people been consulted? How?
• What are the views of users and what are the views of non users?
• Have you done an Equality Impact Assessment?

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

• What implications are there for other strategies e.g. educational attainment, support
for those seeking work, digital inclusion, adult social care?
• Are there other partnerships that can be explored – e.g. with the third sector,
community and development trusts or town and parish councils?
Q2 How efficient is the current service?
• Are the arrangements for the delivery of the library service (eg buildings, staff, service
provision, facilities, online presence etc) meeting the demand of the community and
are they cost efficient?
• What other delivery partnerships could be formed inside and outside the library
authority or region to make the library service more efficient and effective (see
examples in Appendix B)?
• Can the facilities be used more flexibly?
• What are you doing to encourage use and maximise income?
• What scope is there for integrating or co-locating the library service with other
services in the public or private sector (eg council services, post offices, schools,
children’s centres etc)
3. Modernising the process of intervention – set out roles and responsibilities:
Although the Government does not expect to activate the inquiry rules often, the
Government will amend the Public Libraries (Inquiries Procedure) Rules 1992 to
modernise the processes by which the Secretary of State intervenes in a library service.
This will include setting out the roles and responsibilities of the various organisations
involved, the trigger mechanisms for intervening, the processes for holding an inquiry,
and the input of the local community and library users. The principles for all proposed
changes will be to:
• Maintain procedural fairness
• Ensure the processes allow the view of users to be fully communicated
• Strip out bureaucracy
Next steps: The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will amend
secondary legislation and publish advice on the roles and responsibilities as soon as
possible.
4. A strategic body for the libraries sector: The Government is minded to establish
a strategic body for the library sector as a means of providing a stronger national voice
for libraries and improving leadership and development of the sector. As part of the
wider review of arms length bodies, the Government will consider bringing together the
functions of three different organisations – the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council
(MLA), the Advisory Council on Libraries and the Registrar of Public Lending Right. The
Government believes that any such body should be an improvement and development
agency and should have vested in it greater authority than is afforded to the MLA in its
current form. Government therefore proposes that the libraries body has a statutory
advisory function, with the formal power to advise the Secretary of State on his role
under the 1964 Act. Aligning with the Government’s Smarter Government White
Paper10, the library strategic body will be a key part of the DCMS’s drive to modernise
the arrangements for public bodies with a focus on delivering better value and quality
for the public while rationalising administration.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Government recognises that, following the re-organisation of the MLA, that body has
begun to make significant progress. DCMS shall continue to monitor their work and will
take their achievements into account when considering the shape of a new strategic body.
The body would have a statutory role to advise the Secretary of State on oversight
of library services as set out in the 1964 Act, with the following responsibilities:
• Co-ordinator of a voluntary peer review and accreditation programme for public
libraries in England (more detail at proposal 5)
• Improvement and development work for public libraries including guidance, best
practice and advice on:
– Service improvement, user engagement and targeting particular user groups
– Reading and Information
– Governance models
– Co-location and partnership working
– Total Place principles in place-shaping
– Fundraising and commercial ventures
– Digital innovation – lending, digital engagement and communication, digital content
– Learning and skills
• The Public Lending Right administering the PLR Scheme
• A series of national programmes or initiatives as appropriate – could include a
national online catalogue (if money becomes available) or digital content programmes
• Co-ordinating a programme of research and evidence
• Partnership working with Government, third sector and private organisations
Next steps: The Government will undertake a business case in consultation with
stakeholders and will publish more detail as part of the broader review of arms length
bodies, including an assessment of the capability of the MLA to undertake that role
alongside its other functions, including those for museums and archives.
5. Accreditation and peer review: As part of its responsibilities the strategic body for
libraries will devise and run a voluntary peer review and accreditation programmes for
public library services.
6. A LIFT programme for libraries when funds become available: As more public
funds become available in the future, a LIFT programme for libraries should be pursued
whereby capital investment is linked to service improvements.

Chapter 2 – Aim: to reverse the current trend of decline in library usage and
grow the numbers using the library service
7: Communicating the Library Offer to the public: Government recommends all
library authorities make their Library Offer to the public clear and visible to all the
citizens in the area – on their website, in library buildings and through any other local
marketing opportunities.
8: Library Membership as an entitlement from birth: The Government expects that
from April 2011 all library services offer library membership as an entitlement from
birth. This might be achieved in a number of ways:
• Offering Library membership at the registration of a birth
• Offering Library membership along with child benefits
• Offering library membership with Bookstart packs

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

DCMS will ensure that there will be no net additional costs to local authorities in line
with the Government’s new burdens procedures.
9: Attracting new members: Drawing on the guidance in chapter 1, all library
authorities should consider how they attract new members, through seeking greater
community engagement and through community outreach initiatives.
10: Opening hours: Local authorities should review opening hours to assess whether
they meet local need, including that of families. Opening hours should reflect customer
demand.
11: Library buildings: With reference to the guidance set out in proposal 2, local
authorities should regularly review the footprint of the library service to determine
whether they have the right buildings in the right place.
12: Co-location: Local authorities should maximise all partnership and co-location
opportunities.
13: Accessibility: Accessibility of library services should be included as criteria in the
accreditation and peer review scheme.

Chapter 3 – Aim: that the library service is able to respond to limited public
resource and economic pressures
14: Governance and delivery models: All library authorities should consider
innovative ways to generate improvements and efficiencies through shared services,
partnership working, new delivery models and new governance arrangements.
15: RIEPS: Library services, with their parent authorities, should make use of Regional
Improvement and Efficiency Partnerships (RIEPs) to support more innovative joint
service working.
16: Local authority commissioning: All library authorities should do more to respond
to local authority commissioning, developing the necessary understanding and skills to
identify new opportunities for the library service.
17: Supply chain: All library authorities should maximise efficiencies in the stock
supply chain to improve customer experience, and to achieve the best public value.
18: Commercial partnerships: All library services should explore innovative new
funding streams and ways of delivering services through commercial partnerships or
initiatives.
19: Philanthropy: The strategic body for libraries will explore the opportunities for
developing philanthropic giving to the public library service.

Chapter 4 – Aim: to ensure that all libraries respond to a 24/7 culture and to
changing expectations of people who want immediate access to information
20: Customer service: The peer review and accreditation scheme will include criteria
for recognising customer service and responsiveness.
21: Qualifications: Providers of library and information sector courses should develop
and implement a new framework for public library professional qualifications, founded
on user driven policy and practices including customer service and people skills,
community outreach, working with children, marketing and leadership.

9

10

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

22: Evidence skills: Library services should improve their ability to use and evaluate
evidence in order to better illustrate the impact of the service.
23: Advertising library posts: Library services should advertise posts outside the
professional library press and use wider cultural and local government networks, such as
the LGA’s National Graduate Development Programme, to draw in new and diverse talent.
24: Partnership working: Using improved evidence of impact, library leaders should
develop their role as a respected partner in cross-authority strategic partnerships that
deliver improved outcomes for communities.
25: Leadership: Local Authority Chief Executives should include their library leaders in
leadership and management development for senior local authority staff.
26: Volunteers: All libraries should consider how best to attract, nurture and utilise
volunteers, to complement their workforce.

Chapter 5 – Aim: that all libraries grasp the opportunities presented by
digitisation
27: Free internet access: The Government expects that from April 2011 all library
services will provide free internet access to users as part of their Library Offer to the
public. Government will, under section 8(2)(b) of the Public Libraries and Museums Act
1964, make an (affirmative) Order preventing libraries from charging for internet access.
DCMS will ensure that there will be no net additional costs to local authorities in line
with the Government’s new burdens procedures.
28: Support to get online: Government recommends that all library services provide
support and advice for users wanting to get online as part of their Library Offer to the
public.
29: Engaging with UK Online: Libraries should engage with UKOnline for practical
support and are encouraged to bid for funding for projects to help get one million
additional people online over the next 3 years.
30: myguide tool: Government recommend that libraries use the myguide tool to
support the Government’s digital inclusion target for getting one million additional
people online over the next 3 years.
31: Online public services in libraries: Local leaders should consider how they can
use internet access in libraries and UKOnline Centres as a means of allowing access to
online public services.
32: High speed broadband: Local Authorities should actively consider investing in
JANET, the education online network, to provide high speed broadband access in public
libraries.
33: Assessing the demand for e-books: Government recommends that libraries
assess the opportunity and demand for e-book lending in their community, and
develop strategies.
34: Free e-books: Government expects e-books to be loaned for free. Government will
under section 8(2)(b) of the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 make an
(affirmative) Order preventing libraries from charging for e-books lending of any sort
including remotely.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

35: Extending the Public Lending Right to non print books: DCMS will work with
stakeholders to develop the secondary legislation for the extension of the Public Lending
Right to non print books to enable simple, cost effective and easy to use arrangements
for all public libraries.
36: A digital offer: Government recommends that library services use digital
technologies to enhance and complement their existing offer and move towards
providing a 24/7 partnership with other services, such as publishers, commercial
providers and academic libraries and institutions, the NHS and other e-government
services. In the very near future, library services should aim to have an integrated digital
and physical public offer.
37: A national online catalogue: When money becomes available, the strategic body
for libraries will develop a national online library catalogue for library users, building on
the established Unity UK staff-facing catalogue.
38: Social networking in libraries: Government recommends that all libraries allow
access for users to social networking sites which are valuable communication tools and
part of our cultural infrastructure.
39: A national consortium for digital innovation: The strategic body for libraries
will bring together a national consortium of stakeholders including technologists,
publishers, librarians, local authorities and academics to develop a digital innovation
strategy for public libraries.

Chapter 6 – Aim: to demonstrate to citizens, commentators and politicians
that libraries are still relevant and vital
40: Connecting to local priorities: Government recommends that all library
authorities consider connections to local policy priorities and innovate around their
service provisions to align the libraries’ work with local needs and local priorities
eg. Raising educations standards and narrowing gaps in attainment between different
groups in the local population.
41: Contributing to local services: Local authority leaders should actively consider
how their library service could contribute effectively to other local services eg. services
for children, schools and families.
42: Links to the accreditation and peer review schemes: Connections to other
services and policy priorities should be a criteria included in the accreditation and peer
review schemes.
43: Championing partnership working: Local authority chief executives should
champion the partnership agenda for libraries, encouraging relationships with the private
and third sectors as well as those between libraries and other public services or
institutions – for instance early years and children’s centres, schools and their libraries;
and libraries in further and higher education – to deliver improved services and greater
efficiencies, particularly through co-location and joint back office functions.
44: Cross boundary working: Local authorities should ensure they consider cross
boundary working for libraries to improve service delivery and efficiency.
45: Advocacy across Whitehall: DCMS will advocate across Whitehall about the
contribution libraries can make to a broad range of government priorities. This will help
improve access to funding streams and encourage government to use library services to
deliver a broad range of outcomes.

11

12

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

46: Taking Part Survey and library visits for the purpose of paid work and study:
From 2011 the DCMS Taking Part survey will also cover visits to libraries for the purpose
of paid work or academic study as a discrete element.
47: Inclusion of Omnibus questions in the Taking Part survey: From 2011 DCMS
will include the questions from its Omnibus survey – including those on use of library
computers – in the DCMS Taking Part survey to develop an ongoing picture about what
people use libraries for and what library services might be attractive to non users.
48: CLG Place Survey: The Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG)
Place Survey provides information on people’s perceptions of their local area and the
local services they receive. DCMS will analyse the results of this survey alongside DCMS
and CIPFA surveys in order to correlate library membership/use with resident
satisfaction with the local area.
49: Feeding into National Indicators: Government recommends that library
authorities should analyse how their work feeds into the full range of their Local
Authority’s National Indicators and ensure that their contribution is recognised and
aligned with the wider work of the local authority.
50: Future National Indicators: DCMS will work with the Department for Communities
and Local Government (CLG) to develop new measures for any future iteration of the
National Indicator Set, which fully demonstrates and robustly captures the contribution
that a modernised library services can make to delivering local outcomes.
51: Understanding Society Panel Study: DCMS will use Understanding Society – the
largest Panel Study in the world which explores the socio-economic circumstances and
attitudes of 100,000 individuals in 40,000 British households – to provide longitudinal
evidence. We will build on the Panel Study evidence by running a small longitudinal
study with respondents to the DCMS Taking Part Survey in order to gain an ongoing
understanding of the long term impact of library participation.
52: Consortium approach to measuring impact: DCMS and the strategic library
body will bring together partners who have a research interest (universities, third sector
bodies etc) as a consortium to develop a cross sectoral approach to measuring impact.
53: DCMS CASE Programme: As part of wider evidence work across the cultural sector
and using the evidence available, DCMS-led CASE programme is exploring ways to
detect and measure links between library engagement and perceptions of wellbeing. This
work will be published in the coming spring.
54: Contribution to health and wellbeing: The Reading Agency and Loughborough
University Library & Information Statistics Unit (LISU) will this year conduct a major
new project looking at the contribution public libraries are making to the health and
wellbeing of the communities they serve.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Chapter 1
Aim: to drive the quality of all library services up to the level of the best
The Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 (the 1964 Act) sets out the statutory duty
for all local authorities to provide a ‘comprehensive and efficient’ library service set in
the context of local need – specifically of those who live, work and study in the local
area. The 1964 Act imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to oversee and promote
the public library service and to secure discharge of the statutory duties of local
authorities as well as providing certain powers to take action where a local authority is
in breach of its own duty.
Although there was recognition that some aspects of the 1964 Act are outdated, 80%
of respondents to the consultation in local government (and 60% of all respondents)
supported its continued use and the Secretary of State’s power to intervene. 75% felt
that further clarification and definition is needed if the statutory duty is to be
meaningful. The consultation showed strong support for a national offer or user
entitlement across all libraries (85% of respondents were in favour).
The Government therefore judges that the 1964 Act’s imposition of this duty on local
authorities is appropriate and that the Secretary of State’s overview role should be
maintained. We have no plans, therefore, to review the primary legislation but recognise
that the process of intervention needs modernisation.

1. A Library Offer to the public – ‘core’ and ‘local’ offer
The Government believes that the community should be at the heart of the public
library service and building on the work already developed in this area – such as the
Chartered Institute of Librarians and Information Professionals (CILIP) guidelines, the
LoveLibraries campaign and the Youth Offer for Libraries – the Government recommends
that all library authorities introduce a Library Offer to the public. The Library Offer will
be made up of a ‘core offer’ – services which Government believes should be offered
across all library authorities, and a ‘local offer’ – services which are shaped and provided
at local level. The Library Offer can be communicated to the public but can also
illustrate how each library authority is delivering a ‘comprehensive service’ as required
by the 1964 Act. This balance between central best practice guidance and local variation
is in harmony with the Smarter Government White Paper11 which gives increasing
independence and freedom to local authorities whilst recognising an appetite for greater
guidance around legislative duties.
A core offer for all libraries: Government recommends that the core offer for all
libraries should include the following provisions to be made available across all library
authorities:

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

• Library membership from birth: Details of local schemes to ensure that library
membership is available from the earliest point in a child’s life (the Government
expects that from April 2011 all local authorities ensure that library membership is an
entitlement to children from birth. More detail in proposal 8 on p 25)
• An opportunity to have your say and get involved in shaping the service (local
details to be set out)
• Free access to a range and quality of book stock to browse and borrow and
online resources and information that meet local needs (including e-books as the
market grows)
• Access to the national book collection – any book from anywhere: Order any
book through your library (even out of print books)
• Free Internet access for all: Computers and access to online information and
communication. (The Government will change legislation to prevent library authorities
charging for internet access from April 2011. Further details set out in proposal 27
on p 41)
• Help to get online: Support for people using the internet for the first time or
searching for information
• Links to other public services and opportunities: Connections to health, education
and learning or employment opportunities (local details to be set out)
• A Community of Readers: Connecting people to other readers through reading
groups, activities and recommendations
• Flexible opening hours to suit the needs of the local people (local details to be set out)
• Commitment to customer service and expert, helpful staff
• A safe local space which is accessible and convenient for the community
• 24 hour access: Through your library’s online catalogue, online reference and other
services. (Website details to be set out)
• Services which reach out and attract local people (local details to be set out
including ‘at home’ services to housebound people)
• An opportunity to be a member of all libraries in England: Easy to join, accessible
services as announced by the Society of Chief Librarians (SCL)12
The Government believes that these services represent the core offer which should be
provided across all library authorities in England. Most library authorities are already
providing this core service in full but Government recommends that all libraries provide
a universal core offer.
A local offer for libraries: As part of the local element of the Library Offer to the
public, library authorities can shape their offer around local need but might consider
including:
• Commitments on book stock variety, investment and procurement
• Opportunities and activities for young people as part of the local provision of
positive activities
• Provisions for learning such as improving reading and writing skills, and partnerships
with local schools, early years setting and children’s centres
• An Events programme including training events or activities for readers and
author visits

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

• Family activities: Family reading and learning activities – Bookstart Rhymetime
homework clubs, links to family information services, holiday reading challenges.
• Programmes of engagement with the community including outreach initiatives and
ways of encouraging wider usage, including families
• Details of how to get involved with user groups, supporting or influencing the
library service
• Spaces for community use
• Childcare or crèche
• Additional Services like CD and DVD borrowing, book delivery service, coffee shops etc
Other ideas are included throughout this document.
Proposal 1: The Government recommends a Library Offer to the public for all public
libraries in England. The Library Offer will be made up of a ‘core offer’ of services which
all library services should deliver and a ‘local offer’ of services, shaped and delivered at
local level. Government will review the Library Offer after two years and consider
whether to legislate to make it a statutory obligation.
Next steps: Government recommends that library authorities finalise their Library Offer
to the public by the end of 2010.

2. Guidance on processes of engagement and consultation
Most respondents to the consultation agreed that decisions about services, opening hours
and locations must be based on consultation and research in the community. They felt
the decision to close a library should always be part of an agreed strategy which ensures
there is a clear plan for the development of the library service as a whole and that
arrangements to cater for the local community through alternative provisions (especially
the vulnerable or disadvantaged) should be agreed and be in place before the closure.
Sue Charteris’s inquiry into library service provision in the Wirral made a number of
recommendations about a local authority’s duties as set out in the 1964 Act. The
Government recommends that all library authorities familiarise themselves with their
statutory duties13. Library authorities may also wish to consider the findings of the
Charteris Report on the Wirral Library Service14 when developing their library policy and
particularly when considering significant changes to library provision. It is important to
reiterate that the Government recognises that library closures may sometimes be
necessary, but closures must form part of a strategic approach to service provision
and decisions must only be taken after consultation with the community.
Effective engagement is key to understanding community needs and now, under the
Local Government & Public Involvement in Health Act 2008, local authorities have a
statutory duty to involve local people. We recognise that there is no single way of
making an appropriate assessment of the general needs of a community and the specific
needs of adults, children, families and young people. However, we would expect a library
authority to devise a comprehensive vision and development plan for their service based
on some common types of information and data. Sue Charteris expressed these most
clearly in her report.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

When reviewing their service, library authorities should consider the following questions:
Q1 What resources are available and how does this match the needs of the
community?
• Have you analysed and considered need and demand? What are the specific needs of
adults, families and young people of all ages? Would members of the community be
able and willing to contribute to the delivery of library services as volunteers or
joint managers?
• What are the needs of those living, working and studying in the area?
• How accessible is the service? Is public transport appropriate? Are there barriers to
physical access of library buildings that should be removed?
• Have local people been consulted? How?
• What are the views of users and what are the views of non users?
• Have you done an Equality Impact Assessment?
• What implications are there for other strategies e.g. educational attainment, support
for those seeking work, digital inclusion, adult social care?
• Are there other partnerships that can be explored – e.g. with the third sector,
community and development trusts or town and parish councils?
Q2 How efficient is the current service?
• Are the arrangements for the delivery of the library service (eg buildings, staff, service
provision, facilities, online presence etc) meeting the demand of the community and
are they cost efficient?
• What other delivery partnerships could be formed inside and outside the library
authority or region to make the library service more efficient and effective (see
examples in Appendix B)?
• Can the facilities be used more flexibly?
• What are you doing to encourage use and maximise income?
• What scope is there for integrating or co-locating the library service with other
services in the public or private sector (eg council services, post offices, schools,
children’s centres etc)
The questions set out here will already be considered as part of broader strategies in
many areas and can also be used to gather community feedback and help develop the
local offer set out above. It is recommended that library authorities consider these
questions, when they are undertaking reviews of the library service.15
Proposal 2: Sitting alongside the Library Offer to the public, the questions set out
above are issued here as best practice guidance on the processes which Government
recommends library authorities consider under their statutory duty. Government will
review the best practice guidance set out here after two years and consider whether to
legislate to make the guidance statutory.

Library authorities that are seeking to improve their relationship with the community can also consider
the MLA’s advice and the toolkit published in 2006 (http://www.mla.gov.uk/what/publications/2006)

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

3. Modernising the process of intervention – set out roles and
responsibilities
In the event that a local authority fails to demonstrate the link between the design and
delivery of the service and identifiable local need, the Secretary of State may launch an
inquiry to determine whether the authority has breached its duty under the 1964 Act.
Such inquiries are carried out in accordance with the Public Libraries (Inquiries
Procedure) Rules 1992.
These Rules were used for the first time in 2009 and although a number of respondents
to the consultation reported that the Report on the Wirral Inquiry provided some useful
guidance on local authority duties, the process prescribed by the Rules was
cumbersome, bureaucratic and encouraged an adversarial environment. Feedback also
indicates that the procedures were fair and that individuals felt they were able to
communicate and contribute their views.
Although the Government does not expect to activate the inquiry rules often, the Wirral
Inquiry has highlighted the need to reconsider and modernise the processes required by
the legislation.
Proposal 3: The Government will amend the Public Libraries (Inquiries Procedure) Rules
1992 to modernise the processes by which the Secretary of State intervenes in a library
service. This will include setting out the roles and responsibilities of the various
organisations involved, the trigger mechanisms for intervening, the processes for holding
an inquiry, and the input of the local community and library users. The principles for all
proposed changes will be to:
• Maintain procedural fairness
• Ensure the processes allow the view of users to be fully communicated
• Strip out bureaucracy
Next steps: The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will amend secondary
legislation and publish advice on the roles and responsibilities as soon as possible.

4. A strategic body for libraries
89% of respondents to the consultation on this question supported the idea of a Library
Development Agency as recommended by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Libraries,
Literacy and Information Management16. They favoured a body to provide co-ordination
and strategic development of the library service. The Government is convinced by some
of the arguments for an NDPB for libraries but believes that any changes should be in
keeping with wider Government moves to streamline public bodies. Government
recognises that, following the re-organisation of the MLA, that body has begun to make
significant progress. DCMS shall continue to monitor their work and will take their
achievements into account when considering the shape of a new strategic body.

17

18

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Proposal 4: The Government is minded to establish a strategic body for the sector as a
means of providing a stronger national voice for libraries and improving leadership and
development of the sector. As part of the wider review of arms length bodies, the
Government will consider bringing together the functions of three different
organisations – the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), the Advisory Council
on Libraries and the Registrar of Public Lending Right. The Government believes that any
such body should be an improvement and development agency and should have vested
in it greater authority than is afforded to the MLA in its current form. Government
therefore proposes that the libraries body has a statutory advisory function, with the
formal power to advise the Secretary of State on his role under the 1964 Act.
Aligning with the Government’s Smarter Government White Paper17, the library strategic
body will be a key part of the DCMS’s drive to modernise the arrangements for public
bodies with a focus on delivering better value and quality for the public while
rationalising administration.
The body would have a statutory role to advise the Secretary of State on oversight of
library services as set out in the 1964 Act, with the following responsibilities:
• Co-ordinator of a voluntary peer review and accreditation programme for public
libraries in England (more detail at proposal 5)
• Improvement and development work for public libraries including guidance, best
practice and advice on:
– Service improvement, user engagement and targeting particular user groups
– Reading and Information
– Governance models
– Co-location and partnership working
– Total Place principles in place-shaping
– Fundraising and commercial ventures
– Digital innovation – lending, digital engagement and communication, digital content
– Learning and skills
• The Public Lending Right administering the PLR Scheme
• A series of national programmes or initiatives as appropriate – could include a
national online catalogue (if money becomes available) or digital content programmes
• Co-ordinating a programme of research and evidence
• Partnership working with Government, third sector and private organisations
Next steps: The Government will undertake a business case in consultation with
stakeholders and will publish more detail as part of the broader review of arms length
bodies, including an assessment of the capability of the MLA to undertake that role
alongside its other functions, including those for museums and archives.

5. Accreditation and peer review
A key theme from respondents to the consultation was a desire to see more national
monitoring with a national quality standard and an accreditation scheme for libraries.
Government is therefore proposing that the strategic body for libraries introduces a
voluntary accreditation scheme for libraries and expands the current light touch peer
review programme.

(http://www.hmg.gov.uk/media/52788/smarter-government-final.pdf)

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Based on similar models in the museum, tourism and sports sectors, the accreditation
programme will be an opt-in programme for which library services can apply. In the
shorter term, the scheme might be linked to applications for funding opportunities for
libraries so that accreditation can help libraries applying for funding awards. In the longer
term and when funding becomes available, Government will link the accreditation
scheme to a LIFT programme for libraries whereby capital investment is linked to service
improvements. Where there is a positive effect on culture services in the locality, the
scheme may also be reflected in Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA) reporting.
The Peer Review will build on existing initiatives18 and will share best practice, help
facilitate partnerships between local authorities or other services and advise on strategy
for widening usage and connecting to other local authority priorities.
A number of respondents to the consultation suggested that customer satisfaction
needed to be better taken into account when measuring library performance so the
views of users and non users will form part of the accreditation scheme.
The scheme will monitor the implementation of the Library Offer to the public (proposal 1)
and the guidance on processes of engagement and consultation (proposal 2).
Proposal 5: As part of its responsibilities the strategic body for libraries will devise and
run a voluntary peer review and accreditation programmes for public library services.

Proposal 6: As more public funds become available in the future, a LIFT programme for
libraries should be pursued whereby capital investment is linked to service
improvements.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Chapter 2
Aim: to reverse the current trend of decline in library usage and grow the numbers
using the library service
Government recognises that many library authorities have a good story to tell about
their usage figures and this is illustrated by the national surveys of library participation
which show significant differences between the performance of library authorities.
Data collected by The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA)
show that although children’s book issues have been increasing year on year for the past
five years (shown in graph 2), after a brief resurgence from 2002 visits to library
premises fell in 2008/09 (shown in graph 1) and adult book issues and the number of
‘active borrowers’ (those who have borrowed an item from the library in the last 12
months) are down significantly.
CIPFA Public Library statistics for 2008/09 are going through final checks for imminent
publication as we go to print; there may be some minor adjustments incurred.

Graph 2 displays a ten-year trend in issues of books for adults and children from
England’s public libraries. Although there is no evidence of a causal link between book
issues and visits, the graph shows how loans of adults’ books have steadily declined over
the decade, falling by more than a third in that time. Children’s loans, however, fell
steadily until 2003-4 but the downward trend has since reversed, increasing in each of
the last five years. While this is encouraging, the level of children’s loans is still lower
than it was 10 years ago.

The DCMS Taking Part Survey tells us the percentage of the population using libraries.
Use includes physical visits to library premises; use of on-line library resources or services
remotely (i.e. use of a computer outside the library to view the website, catalogue or
databases); access, and receipt, of the library service by email, telephone, fax or letter and
receipt of an outreach service such as home delivery or library events outside a library
building19. The survey shows an increase in the proportion of children using libraries
(illustrated in graph 3) but a significant and year on year decline in the proportion of the
adult population doing so (shown in graph 4). Fortunately analysis shows that there is a
clear link between engagement as a child and participation as an adult. Increasing
children’s use of libraries builds audiences for the future20.

Further consideration of the statistics is set out in chapter 6, but Government believes
that with only children’s use increasing there is a clear message in this data which we
cannot simply ignore. Even where local figures are good it continues to be vital for library
authorities to do all they can to attract new members and maintain their regular visitors.
To improve intelligence on the market demand for library services we included some
questions about library use and non-use in an Omnibus survey to find out more about
the activities being undertaken in libraries and explore where non library users might
have an interest in library services21.

Libraries Omnibus Findings
In December 2009, DCMS commissioned Ipsos MORI to carry out research into public
library usage involving face-to-face surveys with a representative sample of 5000 people
aged 15+ in England. Through DCMS Taking Part surveys and CIPFA, we have knowledge
about the number of public library users and of visits made, but have been lacking data
regarding other aspects of library usage. The survey was designed with two main aims:
• To find out what people visit public libraries to do.
• To investigate the level of latent demand – that is, how many people are doing
activities elsewhere that could potentially be done in a library?
Library users: 41% of our sample had been to a public library in the past 12 months22.
The activities done by these library users is summarised on the following page23:

21

http://www.dcms.gov.uk/reference_library/research_and_statistics/6753.asp
This variance from the 37.5% Taking Part figure is most likely down to the different sampling methods
utilised in the two studies rather than a recent, sudden rise in library visitor numbers.
23
‘Other’ includes attending a group or class, getting help using a computer, reading a magazine or
newspaper, and using a photocopier.

Activity

Potential library users: There is a high degree of potential demand – that is people
who have not been to a public library in the past 12 months, but who have taken part in
an activity which could have been undertaken in a public library. Therefore there is the
potential that these people could become library users. For instance, of the 48.5% of our
sample who had not visited a library in the past 12 months, 31.2% had either borrowed
or wanted to borrow a book. That is 15% of our total sample.

Digital engagement: Of those who access the internet via a public place (4.8% of our
sample), just over half had done so in a public library. So there is potential for a rise in
the number of people using public libraries for internet access. Computer usage in a
public library reduces as income rises, suggesting that this provision is serving the lower
income members of the community. 12% of our sample had used the internet to look
at public library websites.

24

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

The consultation elicited a variety of ideas on the question of how to increase
participation with a majority of respondents supporting better communication of what
the public library service offers and a number of respondents emphasising the
importance of location and opening hours.

6. Communicating the Library Offer to the public effectively
Many respondents to the consultation felt that there is more to be done to promote the
benefits of libraries to those who do not currently use them. Consumers need to know
what they can expect from their local library service, yet many public libraries are not
publicising their offer in terms that the public can understand, and there are too many
perceived barriers to use. The Library Offer to the public represents a commitment to
the community and can help communicate library services to users and non users alike.
It also reflects the importance of giving people guarantees of high quality public
services, as set out in the Smarter Government White Paper.24 The Government
therefore proposes the following:
Proposal 7: Government recommends all library authorities make their Library Offer to
the public clear and visible to all the citizens in the area – on their website, in library
buildings and through any other local marketing opportunities.

7. Attracting new members, engaging effectively with the community,
and community outreach
There are a number of schemes operating at national and local level which are
successful in attracting new library members and promoting reading. Lead by The
National Literacy Trust and The Reading Agency, the National Year of Reading in 2008
encouraged 2.3 million people to join the library25 and Bookstart baby packs successfully
encourage parents to enrol their children as library members26. Last year the Summer
Reading Challenge, involving 95% of libraries and spearheaded by the Reading Agency
during the long school holiday, saw 725,000 children participating with 47,000
becoming new library members.27
The consultation responses and the Community Led Reference Group for this review
identified the importance of engaging in outreach activities in order to attract new,
often hard to reach, library users. In Manchester, when funding from existing budgets
was identified to create a temporary outreach and promotions assistant, a new
approach was taken to targeting the 72% of residents that did not already have a library
ticket. A portable mini-library with wheeled shelf units and bearing a selection of
seasonal stock was taken round to potentially fruitful recruiting grounds including the
town hall, large private companies and HE institutions. By Summer 2009 the library
service had held 45 ‘Meet the Neighbours’ sessions and recruited 3,750 new members.
All library authorities should consider how they can shape services to respond to the
locally identified needs of their community – including families28. This, in turn, helps
develop services which appeal to new users and which might be cost effective in a
constrained financial environment.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Leeds Library and Information Service: engagement project
When Leeds Library and Information service was awarded £1.4 million from the Big
Lottery Fund Communities Libraries Programme to extend and refurbish a dull 1960’s
library in Garforth into a new vibrant creative space and One Stop Centre, a
comprehensive community engagement plan was adopted to ensure that communities
could influence the service the new building would provide. Parents, business
representatives, children of primary school age, older people and representatives from the
voluntary sector were consulted and focus groups were held. A community Steering Group
selected a large proportion of the book stock for the new library. The success of the project
is illustrated by visitor statistics – 1600 people attended the first family day at the library.

Proposal 8: We know children benefit in many ways from early access to books and
reading29. The Government therefore expects that from April 2011 all library services
offer library membership as an entitlement from birth. This might be achieved in a
number of ways:
• Offering Library membership at the registration of a birth30
• Offering Library membership along with child benefits
• Offering library membership with Bookstart packs
Two thirds of libraries already provide library membership information with packs
which are distributed to all children at 7- 9 months31. DCMS will ensure that there
will be no net additional costs to local authorities in line with the Government’s new
burdens procedures.

Proposal 9: Drawing on the guidance in chapter 1, all library authorities should consider
how they attract new members, through seeking greater community engagement and
through community outreach initiatives.

8. Providing an accessible library service
Opening hours: People’s lives have changed and people’s expectations have also
changed. Library opening hours need to respond to their customers’ needs and wants –
including those of families. Out of hours access was a key access issue confirmed
through the consultation – particularly by library users who emphasised the importance
of determining opening hours in consultation with the community. Libraries can

29

A Report by the Sutton Trust suggests a child taken to the library on a monthly basis from ages 3 to 5 is
two and a half months ahead of an equivalent child at age 5 who did not visit the library so frequently
(http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/news/images/userfiles/file/Early_years_report%20final.doc). The Centre for
Longitudinal Studies at the Institute of Education’s Millennium Cohort Study, which by following nearly
19,000 children born at the start of the 21st century until they are 11 will gauge the long-term impact of
poverty, parenting, education, health, religion and ethnicity on their formative years, has found that
children whose parents read to them every day at the age of three were more likely to flourish in their
first year in primary school, getting more than two months ahead not just in language and literacy but
also in maths (www.cls.ioe.ac.uk)
30
The Tell Us Once service may help library authorities administer these arrangements. Tell Us Once joins up
government for citizens so that they only need to inform central and local government just once of changes
in their circumstances such as a birth or a death. Tell Us Once is a cross government programme based
within DWP and works in partnership with local authorities, Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC),
Identity and Passport Service (IPS), and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) to deliver services the
way customers want them. Each local council will tailor the needs of their residents and one of the services
that a citizen can notify about the birth of a child is their local council Library service. Tell Us Once will
become a national programme in May and information will be accessed via Directgov from that point.

consider using volunteers to help deliver longer opening hours. 14.7% of respondents to
DCMS Taking Part survey who had not visited a public library in 2007/08 said they did
not have time to go. The most innovative libraries are changing – opening later in the
evening and opening on Sundays.
For example, in Suffolk Sunday opening was introduced across the whole service in 2003
with a view to attracting 5,200 additional visitors per week. That happened and seven
years later the service continues to attract more people and all 44 libraries remain open
on Sundays
Proposal 10: Local authorities should review opening hours to assess whether they meet
local need, including that of families. Opening hours should reflect customer demand.
Buildings infrastructure: Libraries offer a rare social and versatile space for multi­
generational use and most are busy and well-loved. Communities should have access to
welcoming, high quality library buildings in the right place and open at the right times
for their users. There are some fantastic new libraries with iconic designs, innovative
services and inventive links to local people. The popularity of new builds confirms the
‘pulling power’ of the buildings infrastructure. For instance, the new library in
Bournemouth town centre was built and funded as a PFI pathfinder project. It is 3.5
times larger than the library it replaced and includes retail units. In its first year alone
visits increased by 120% and stock issues increased by 50%. Almost 5000 new
borrowers registered in the first week. In 2007 the Big Lottery Fund awarded £80m
investment to build and refurbish libraries across 58 authorities with a key requirement
to engage communities in planning.32
As set out in proposal 6, as more public funds become available in the future, a LIFT
capital programme for libraries should be pursued whereby capital investment is linked
to specific service improvements, and to the accreditation scheme.
Small libraries in communities make an important contribution to the library
infrastructure and mobile libraries and ‘library access points’ in community spaces can
be an attractive alternative in some communities to dedicated library buildings. This
approach has been successful in the East Riding of Yorkshire where, until a fundamental
review of the mobile library service was carried out in 2000-01, communities were
missing out on a modern library service due to the predominantly rural nature of the
area and lack of dedicated library buildings. The new mobile vehicle provides a broad
range of services and now many somewhat isolated rural communities have the
equivalent of a one-stop-shop on their doorstep.
Proposal 11: With reference to the guidance set out at proposal 2, local authorities
should regularly review the footprint of the library service to determine whether they
have the right buildings in the right place.
Co-location: Co-location of services can help to widen usage and make valuable links
for the user. Respondents to the consultation said co-location works when it brings
together complementary services on an equal footing. Effective co-location of libraries
with other services – such as health or employment services, post offices, leisure
services, schools, early years settings and children’s centres, universities or other
educational institutions – enables innovation, offers value for money and delivers a

32

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

coherent, joined-up approach to the public. Respondents to the consultation agreed that
co-located libraries can be used as community hubs. The Total Place initiative provides
co-location opportunities for local authorities (more details of Total Place on p 30).
Libraries are viable and valued partners for co-location because:
• Libraries are a universal service
• Libraries are free, community spaces
• They are widely used by the individuals and community groups other partners want
to reach33
• They provide free access to quality information, reading and Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) resources which support and complement the work
of many partners, particularly in health, education and learning
• Library spaces are relatively inexpensive to fit out in a shared building
VAT position on co-location: Co-location with other services is an important route to
improved services and increased efficiency but, as with any innovation, there are barriers
to achieving successful partnerships – most commonly the impact on the normally
beneficial VAT position of the local authority. This has caused some local authorities to
think twice, but it is possible to mitigate the potential impact of VAT by understanding
and considering the issues at the outset of the project. Further information on this issue
can be found in the separate study which accompanies this publication.34
Proposal 12: Local authorities should maximise all partnership and co-location
opportunities.

Proposal 13: Accessibility of library services should be included as criteria in the
accreditation and peer review scheme.

33

In 2008, CFE Consulting surveyed library users in deprived areas of the North East and found that they
largely reflected the target groups for the government careers advice service, nextstep, and the Regional
Employability Framework (REF). 61% of the people interviewed were of ‘working age’ (17-64) with below
Level 4 qualifications and in socio-economic grades C1, C2, D or E. 34% lived in social housing, 17% were
claiming Income Support and the mean annual personal income of participants was £8,600, below
regional and national averages. Approximately 1 in 5 (19%) of library users had used a library to find out
about, and make choices relating to, learning and work in the last two years (http://tinyurl.com/y8rnf2f)

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Building Schools for the Future (BSF) is providing a catalyst to plan strategically and
invest in facilities for the delivery of educational and social outcomes for children, young
people and wider communities. These programmes offer a framework which allows
partners, including library services, to think about how different professionals and
organisations can work together towards a common goal and make the most of the
available resources. Key elements of school delivery such as family learning and extended
curriculum provision can all be delivered effectively through a range of different cultural
professionals, with libraries offering resources and expertise to school delivery.
BSF is the largest capital investment programme of its kind for 50 years, and nearly a
third of all secondary schools in England are now involved in the BSF programme. Every
local authority engaged in BSF must develop a Cultural Stakeholder Group to engage
with relevant local stakeholders and are required to develop plans which include their
entire education and learning estate35.

Chapter 3
Aim: that the library service is able to respond to limited public resource and
economic pressures
As local authorities face tough choices over how to manage council tax, encourage
growth in their local areas and protect high quality local services, central Government
encourages councils to prioritise the protection of frontline services to the public, like
the public library service.
Responses to the library review consultation recognised the tough climate for public
resources and the risks of cuts to public libraries. Like other public sector services, local
authorities are under pressure to improve the sustainability of libraries and boost their
incomes. This can be difficult and local authorities need to balance income generation
against creating barriers to use. Research in 2008 found that funding innovation in
libraries is traditionally poor. Almost 80% of library services thought they could do more
to achieve sustainability, but as a local authority body, felt constrained in trying new
ways of working and developing income streams36.

9. Governance and delivery models
There is a growing mixed economy of delivery models and governance across library
authorities, ranging from new multiple service trust models, commissioning of the
library service by private companies or outsourcing of the back office functions. There
are already examples of substantial partnership working, shared services and library
authorities exploring mergers and permanent partnerships across boundaries. The
impetus for change in the business model of libraries is often as a result of local
authority rationalisation and an onus on delivering efficiencies through shared training,
procurement and improvement. However, there are also opportunities for improvements
and better services to customers through shared learning and partnership working.
Responses to the consultation suggested that a number of local authorities are gauging
other authorities’ experiences of alternative governance models, emphasising the
importance of sharing information across local authority boundaries. A number of
respondents considered that bespoke solutions would be needed for different areas with
no single structure universally relevant.
The Government believes that the current model of 151 library authorities is
unsustainable. Library authorities must look at new delivery models if they are to
continue to offer citizens a comprehensive service at local level. Library services will
need to either work closely together, merge with other authorities or establish new
trust models or private/public partnerships. There may also be opportunities to share

services with university libraries and collaborate on opening times, access and
management of stock.
The Total Place initiative may provide a vehicle for exploring those opportunities and
help to identify valuable improvements and efficiencies. The Total Place initiative fits
with the Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA) and requires local services to
understand the needs of their communities and work in partnership to tackle local
challenges. There are 13 Total Place pilot areas focussing on themes covering physical &
mental health of adults & children, crime & antisocial behaviour, deprivation,
worklessness, asset management and procurement. Engaging library services as a partner
in Total Place could identify valuable improvements and efficiencies and, given their role
as community hubs, libraries could be a critical part of this process.37
Local authorities are already operating alternative models to the delivery of their library
services. These include:
Wigan (Charitable Trust Model) Wigan Leisure & Culture Trust has made major
investment in Wigan Council’s libraries, museums and leisure centres. The Trust’s most
significant investment funding has come from not having to pay business rates (saving
£500,000). The Trust has been able to spend an extra £1.5m over the last five years on
extended opening hours, new stock and increased partnership projects with schools,
health and children’s centres.
Luton (Charitable Trust and Company Limited by Guarantee) Luton’s cultural services
(museums, libraries and arts) are now a Trust. A charity running the services on a notfor-profit basis has meant resources not available to the Council have been accessed and
speedier decisions made with focus given to providing a first class services to customers.
In addition to these governance models some local authorities are examining the
opportunity for shared back office and front office partnerships and mergers.
• For instance, in the East of England, the SPINE project has been established to
identify a viable option for sharing library services in the region which can deliver
savings and efficiency for each of its six council partners38. The project has funding
from Improvement East (the regional improvement and efficiency body) with
additional funding from MLA, and both cash and in-kind contributions from each of
the councils. By September 2010, the project will have explored governance
arrangements, identified an appropriate delivery vehicle, and scoped out a catalogue
of services. From the start, the founding partners have recognised that this model may
be scaleable and transferable, so recognise it may offer a range of opportunities which
go beyond libraries. In each case the drivers for involvement include efficiency and
value for money, with a shared vision around developing innovation and public benefit.
• London Library Change Programme: Supported by Capital Ambition, London’s
Regional Improvement and Efficiency Partnership, research for the London Library
Change Programme identified that costs and service quality varies widely across public
libraries in London with no correlation between the two. Only by boroughs working
together can public expectations be met, while bearing down on costs in the new
financial environment. Individual local services will continue to offer bespoke library
services to meet local need in consultation with residents but the programme aims to
result in shared back-office services and a unified approach to stock management and
procurement. This will enable the library user to get books more quickly while driving

The six founding partners are Essex, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Hertfordshire, Thurrock and Southend

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

down costs. Employing best practice in deployment of staff will improve value for
money and, ultimately, the customer experience.
South East Library Management System: Different IT systems can limit opportunities
for improved partnership working. South East Library Management System (SELMS) is a
consortium of public library authorities set up in 2005 to explore opportunities to work
in partnership to effectively renew and improve library management systems.
Key benefits for library customers and staff include:
• a larger pool of lending stock available
• optimum use of front desk and administrative personnel resources
• improved ability to provide an increasing range of services at a reasonable and
consistent cost
• better interoperability with other library services
• opportunities to explore other back office efficiencies jointly39
There is no one size fits all solution to the efficiency challenges facing library services
and library authorities should research their options thoroughly, drawing on the
experience of other libraries, the MLA and other experts. Whatever the arrangement, the
library authority continues to be accountable and answerable for the statutory duty.
Proposal 14: All library authorities should consider innovative ways to generate
improvements and efficiencies through shared services, partnership working, new
delivery models and new governance arrangements.

Proposal 15: Library services, with their parent authorities, should make use of Regional
Improvement and Efficiency Partnerships (RIEPs) to support more innovative joint
service working.

10. Commissioning structures
Rather than rationing resources by departmental silos, local government is moving
towards commissioning services according to their contribution to local priorities. As
many Heads of Service already recognise, this presents an opportunity for libraries
because of the contribution they make to wider policies. Successful Library services
must be able to position themselves as partners of choice and offer services of
recognised value to local policy goals.
Commissioners need to be informed about what libraries provide and libraries must be
pro-active in offering solutions to local priorities. Without compromising their core
purpose libraries can respond to local priorities and are delivering enhanced services and
increasing funding opportunities.

39

The six founding members of SELMS are Wokingham Borough Council (procurement lead), Brighton and
Hove City Council, Buckinghamshire County Council, Milton Keynes Council, West Berkshire Council and
the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (administrative lead). Since the consortium became live
six other partners have joined, three of whom are now operating on the joint system. These three are Kent
County Council, Medway Borough Council & the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham. More
recent members, who will go live over the next twelve months, are Slough Borough Council and the
London Borough of Camden.

31

32

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

For instance, in Luton, the Primary Care Trust has just commissioned the Library Service
to buy a collection of books for Books on Prescription, and the Borough Council Early
Years section is funding them to extend Books on Prescription to children and
adolescents. The Early Years Service in Northamptonshire has commissioned the
county’s library service to run children’s centres in three libraries. As well as providing
information, activities and resources for parents and carers with preschool children and
links to a wide variety of partners (including health, child minders, local voluntary
groups and schools), team librarians are commissioned to deliver family reading groups
and to provide 1:1 support to help improve parents’ employability e.g. CV writing,
interview skills, general IT skills, literacy and numeracy. Four further libraries in the
county are designated to become co-located Children’s Centres.
Proposal 16: All library authorities should do more to respond to local authority
commissioning, developing the necessary understanding and skills to identify new
opportunities for the library service.

11. Supply Chain
Many library authorities have worked hard at maximising efficiencies in the stock supply
chain driven by the desire to improve customer experience, and to achieve the best
public value. It is vital that all libraries do so.
Almost all library authorities in England are part of wider book purchasing consortia
with other library authorities or other local authority partners. Consortia can help drive
down procurement costs resulting in better value for library authorities and more books
for library customers.
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI): Libraries that employ full EDI have in place a totally
computerised process for stock purchasing, from initial price quoting, to final invoice
payment. This can lead to efficiencies by freeing staff from routine ‘back office’ duties.
There are accreditation schemes which recognise best practice in EDI to which libraries
can freely apply40.
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that is gaining in popularity
with libraries because of the flexibility it provides around (typically) self service, security,
and stock management. Using RFID to manage the book stock provides libraries with
better flexibility to locate, refresh, transfer, present and issue stock, leading to an
improved customer experience. The best RFID systems contribute to efficiency; doing
more with the same resources; or doing more with less. Staff can be re-assigned in ways
that improve customer service and cost-efficiency.
Proposal 17: All library authorities should maximise efficiencies in the stock supply
chain to improve customer experience, and to achieve the best public value.

12. Fundraising and Commercial partnerships
Councils need not always look to fund service improvements through their budgets.
Creating new opportunities, as libraries are already doing, by exploring innovative revenue
streams, sponsorship and commercial partnerships can generate income for the service.

40

http://www.bic.org.uk/e4libraries/

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Respondents to the consultation identified advertising, coffee shop concessions and
working with booksellers as potential income generators. Some respondents warned that
libraries’ neutrality should not be compromised by commercial opportunities and that it
would be inappropriate for libraries to form partnerships that could be perceived as
being in any way controversial e.g. with fast food outlets.
In Northamptonshire the library service is generating money by offering personal
financial advice to residents through the library for a small fee and in Hillingdon there is
a partnership with Starbucks providing cafes.York Library Service has matched funding
with Aviva to improve the financial capability of the people of York. The company’s
investment has also contributed towards the transformation of York central library into
an ‘explore centre’ with more books, state of the art learning rooms equipped with the
latest learning technologies, a quiet room, a café, changing facilities, self service
machines, a new flexible ICT learning centre and Wi-Fi Internet throughout. Birmingham
Library hosts an annual event for Global Entrepreneurship Week, to raise the profile of
the library within the business and entrepreneurial community and as a contribution to
city council economic priorities, and is exploring the further development of corporate
sponsorship with advice from Arts and Business. Luton Library Service has a link to
Amazon on the library website and every purchase made via this link generates income
for Luton Cultural Services Trust, starting at 5% of the cost price, and rising as more
items are purchased.
Libraries have also had considerable success in securing capital funding through
commercial partnerships. The £2 million library and Workzone in Shepherds Bush was
built and fitted out at zero cost to the taxpayer through Section 106 agreements with
developers. Successful Private Finance Initiatives have funded a number of significant
library developments including the joint Worcester public and university library (in
development), the Jubilee Library in Brighton, the Downham Health and Leisure Centre
in Lewisham and Newcastle’s Central Library. Since 2000 the Government has invested
over £500m of PFI credits in nearly 40 projects to build or refurbish libraries or to
include a public library in part of a larger construction project.
Respondents to the consultation acknowledged the opportunities to learn from the
private sector on issues like marketing, display/layout of buildings, targeting and
understanding customers (using data on customers to encourage use), performance
management of staff or procurement and contract management. In Devon, library
managers are learning from John Lewis’ managers in order to maximise how they display
library stock to encourage ‘impulse borrowing’, and performance management of staff.
Proposal 18: All library services should explore innovative new funding streams and
ways of delivering services through commercial partnerships or initiatives.

13. Philanthropy
Beyond the opportunities for commercial partnerships and business sponsorship, public
libraries could do much more to promote philanthropy and to benefit from the
generosity of private donors across society. The legacy of Andrew Carnegie continues to
provide public benefit well over a century after the first libraries were set up in his
name, but where is his 21st Century successor? Philanthropists today continue to give
generously to a broad range of good causes, and public libraries are equally deserving of
their support. How do we identify and cultivate major donors, and their financial

33

34

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

advisors? That requires strong and visionary leadership, and a commitment to long-term
relationship management. Strong donor development skills are in short supply in the
public library sector. It is also unlikely to be done best by individual library authorities,
but rather on a national basis.
Proposal 19: The strategic body for libraries will explore the opportunities for
developing philanthropic giving to the public library service.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Chapter 4
Aim: to ensure that all libraries respond to a 24/7 culture and to changing
expectations of people who want immediate access to information
A small but vocal element of consultation responses support a clear vision of libraries as
singly a book loaning service with a mantra of ‘if you buy the books, they will come’.
Book stock, of course, is vital, and as the recent DCMS Omnibus survey confirms41,
books are the main reason why people go to the library. But which books and what
other library services? As all the best Heads of Service know, libraries cannot passively
sit back and wait for people to borrow books – however good the stock is. There is
already a culture of helpfulness in the library workforce – in the last National PLUS
survey (2006-07) more than 95% of respondents considered staff helpfulness was very
good (72.5%) or good (23.8%)42. This culture should be nurtured and celebrated. The
library workforce and policy makers must continue to build on this and actively engage
with local people, finding out what they want and need from their service, and respond
to those needs. And in a 24/7 culture, that is not about a stagnant book stock.

14. Providing a customer focused workforce
Library services need a flexible and user responsive workforce to offer the level of
customer experience that the public want, but while there is excellent best practice, some
services remain unable to meet this challenge. At the head of most innovative library
services is someone who can respond to change with speed and imagination and who
can ensure local leaders understand and advocate for the library service. Successful heads
of service clearly articulate the benefits that libraries can deliver and can empower staff
to manage, promote and innovate within the service in the best way possible.
Increasingly, new library leaders will not have come up through the service itself.
Supported by the right mix of staff, competencies in people and project management;
business development; performance management and advocacy are increasingly vital.
Future leaders need a proactive and entrepreneurial approach, seeking continual service
improvement and pursuing and making partnerships with the public, private and third
sectors where they see the potential for public benefit and the delivery of shared priorities.
73% of those that commented on the relevance of library courses in their consultation
response felt they did not have the relevant content or teach the right skills to equip
the library workforce. The modern library workforce can and should be drawn from a
wide range of skills and experience such as youth work, community development or
adult education to fulfil the service’s potential to flexibly respond to the needs and
expectations of users. IT, marketing, and entrepreneurial skills and information-handling
skills are considered essential now.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Government expects that posts requiring library qualifications will be necessary to
oversee strategic planning and improvement and will support and lead the teams
managing branch libraries and delivering community engagement. We may need fewer
qualified librarians, but where such change is part of a well planned strategic review, the
new professional posts are usually better defined, well paid jobs which clearly add value
to the service.
Library services are best when staffed by a mixture of professionals including librarians
and people qualified for work in other fields. The diagram at Appendix C illustrates the
mix of workforce skills necessary to deliver a modernised library service. A broad range
of generic skills and attributes underpins a successful contemporary service and these
skills may be derived from different careers and training routes. Above all, the sector
must be receptive to new ways of working to ensure that libraries satisfy customer
demands and deliver a modernised service.
Proposal 20: The peer review and accreditation scheme will include criteria for
recognising customer service and responsiveness.

Proposal 21: Providers of library and information sector courses should develop and
implement a new framework for public library professional qualifications, founded on
user driven policy and practices including customer service and people skills, community
outreach, working with children, marketing and leadership.
Training and development: To address unhelpful hierarchical structures, a whole
workforce approach needs to be taken to training provision. Some library services
already work in partnership with local training and skills providers, including library and
information schools, to develop the training they need. More services could develop this
model or partner with existing schemes. DCMS will work with The Department for
Children Schools and Families (DCSF) to help library staff benefit from professional
development in working with children and their families and in promoting the
importance of children’s language development, sharing ideas for supporting children
and their parents from the Every Child a Talker programme.
Mentoring and work-shadowing opportunities are effective and make senior positions
more attainable and transparent. Despite having the biggest workforce in the cultural
sector, libraries have a low number of applicants for apprenticeships and the Clore
Leadership Programme43.
Proposal 22: Library services should improve their ability to use and evaluate evidence
in order to better illustrate the impact of the service44.

Proposal 23: Library services should advertise posts outside the professional library
press and use wider cultural and local government networks, such as the LGA’s National
Graduate Development Programme, to draw in new and diverse talent.

43

The Clore Leadership Programme is an initiative of the Clore Duffield Foundation which aims to
strengthen leadership across a wide range of cultural activities including libraries.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Proposal 24: Using improved evidence of impact, library leaders should develop their
role as a respected partner in cross-authority strategic partnerships that deliver
improved outcomes for communities.

Proposal 25: Local Authority Chief Executives should include their library leaders in
leadership and management development for senior local authority staff.
Volunteers: Volunteers play an important role in supporting key activities by providing
services such as home visits and supporting staff in the library team.
The Workforce Reference Group to this review discussed the benefits of volunteers who
often have skills which complement (but don’t replace) staff expertise. In Leicester
library service, Paul Hamlyn Foundation ‘Welcome to Your Library’ and Home Office
‘Challenge Fund’ money was used to encourage asylum seekers and refugees to engage
with the service as volunteers in 2005. 15 out of 22 of the participants went on to find
jobs, one of them in the library and, at their suggestion, new informal learning
programmes have been developed that continue to attract Black and Minority Ethnic
(BME) audiences45.
Without radical change in the workforce, library services will not be able to modernise
nor achieve the potential role set out here. Real change needs partnership working,
leadership within local government and the library sector and a readiness from all library
staff to embrace a new role.
Proposal 26: All libraries should consider how best to attract, nurture and utilise
volunteers, to complement their workforce.

Chapter 5
Aim: that all libraries grasp the opportunities presented by digitisation
Libraries’ traditional role has been providing books, learning and information and it is
critical that we transpose that role into the digital world where a vast quantity of
information is online and citizens, more than ever, need support in navigating through it.
The consultation showed strong support for libraries to embrace a digital agenda with
many respondents arguing digital is crucial for libraries to remain relevant.
Changes in the market – such as the mass digitisation of content by Google and others,
Web 2.0 technology and the advent of e-books – are changing how people want to
receive and engage with information. In 2006/07 there were 180 million visits to local
authority websites in England and 48 million of them were to public library sites. Visits
to public library websites in 2007/08 grew to 57 million46. As many library authorities
pointed out in their consultation responses, consumption of digital information has
been transforming the library’s role as an information provider over the last ten years.
Digital media offer new opportunities to libraries. They can help the service to:
• Be more accessible more of the time.
• Bridge the digital divide for those people without online access or skills.
• Offer a broader range of content and resources and new ways of accessing,
manipulating and comparing information.
• Attract new users to library services: a recent survey suggests that online usage has a
positive effect on in person visits in libraries47.
• Be more efficient and cost effective, both directly for the public and the back of house
operation.
Public libraries are embracing digital opportunities at very different rates. For instance all
public libraries have an online presence but only about 14 currently offer e-book loans.
The Government believes that all libraries must embrace their digital mission as integral
to their role.

15. Libraries at the heart of Digital Inclusion
At a time when around 80% of the population is online, citizens now see access to the
internet as a right rather than a ‘nice to have’. Libraries have a central role to play in
providing access to the internet and helping people get online, supporting the delivery of
the national digital priorities set out by the Government and the Champion for Digital
Inclusion, Martha Lane Fox. There are 12.5 million adults in the UK who do not use the
internet today and this group will rely heavily on libraries to reach online information,
including public services which will increasingly be delivered online. The National Plan for

Digital Participation48 sets out the Government’s vision, shared with business and the
third sector through the Consortium for the promotion of Digital Participation, of helping
everyone who wants to be online to get online, do more online and benefit from the
advantages of being online.
Delivery of online services has already brought significant benefits to both Government
and users. As local authorities move more of their services online there are opportunities
for significant budget savings:
• Services such as NHS Choices have provided a step change in e-Health delivery in the
UK. NHS Choices had 5.2 million visitors a month as at January 2009.
• The Electronic Vehicle Licensing (EVL) scheme, which enables customers to tax their
car online, saves the DVLA around £8m per annum, and attracted 18m users last year.
For every additional re-licensing transaction that is processed through the EVL channel
a further 93p will be saved.
• The Government Whole Farm Approach enables farmers to provide a common set of
information once to all of the interested agencies, reducing form filling by 15% and
saving the industry £16.5m per annum49.
• The new DCSF-funded Family Information Directory (FIDy) is an online service to all
families that signposts to local and national services. Local Authority Family Information
Services (FIS) are already required to provide information to the local community. By
using the FIDy – and partnering with their local FIS – libraries could generate savings by
not needing to maintain their own local directories of services for families
As a consequence of this online provision, local authorities must ensure that everyone
can access those digital public services. In December, Putting the Frontline First: Smarter
Government White Paper50 recognised that online government had to mean 100% online
citizens and announced it will invest £30 million with UKOnline Centres to support the
development of the National Plan for Digital Participation to get more than one million
people online in the next three years. Libraries are a vital component in guaranteeing that
universal access, and libraries and UKOnline Centres must collaborate to position
themselves in a central role to co-ordinate and signpost these e-government services – a
function which mirrors the pivotal role libraries already hold in helping people find
support and information. Two thousand libraries are already UKOnline Membership
Centres and working collaboratively with UK Online and will be able to bid for funding
for projects from this scheme over the next three years.51 To help meet the target to get
one million people online, libraries should use the myguide online registration package52
(only 53% do at present). Online basics is part of the myguide package and can help
people taking their first steps with computers and the internet to get online53.
A recent MLA survey about online access in libraries highlights the substantial role libraries
already play in providing internet access for their communities. 79% of library services in
English local authorities provide free internet access and a further 12% charge nothing for
the first hour (91% in total). 98% of local authorities provide access in the evening and at

weekends. 72% of library services have provided digital training to their frontline staff to
support them in providing help to library users to get them online. 86% of library services
report that they provide support to the unemployed to get online and 76% support online
job-searches54. The recent DCMS Omnibus survey on libraries suggests that 50% of people
who use the internet in a public space did so in a public library55.
To support online access in libraries, in December 2009, the MLA brokered an agreement
with Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and Joint Academic NetworkUK
(JANET(UK)), who respectively fund and operate the JANET education and research
network, to give public libraries access to a wider range of high quality online learning
resources and the option of a faster internet service. JANET connection speeds are 1
gigabit per second (1Gbit/s) – up to ten times more than existing typical bandwidths at
central libraries in England, which in turn can be ten times greater than home connections.
The People’s Network: £100 million National Lottery fund was invested in the People’s
Network programme which launched in 2000. Delivered by the MLA, the People’s
Network supported the development of ICT learning in public libraries through the
provision of 30,000 internet enabled computers. It linked every public library in the UK
to the internet by the end of 2002. The expansion in hardware capacity, coupled with
increased opening hours in many libraries, meant that over 68.5 million hours of
potential internet use were being provided by libraries across the UK every year.
Monitoring data collected from all public libraries in England showed 11.7 million user
sessions on the People’s Network in 200356. From 1999 a related £20 million ICT
training programme equipped public library staff with skills, knowledge and confidence
to use ICT effectively in their day-to-day work supporting users of the People’s Network.
A survey by MORI for the National Audit Office in March 2004 found that 16% of the
public aged 16 and over have used the internet at a public library. Despite this
significant progress in equipping libraries with digital capability there are weaknesses in
the public library digital infrastructure offer. Respondents to the consultation confirmed
that the People’s Network is now often run down although many local authorities have
invested in new computers and training. Broadband speeds are variable and local
authority IT networks often hamper the digital offer.
Silver Surfers’ Day
Silver Surfers’ Day, co-ordinated by Digital Unite, provides an opportunity to positively
encourage older people to take the first step to get online by participating in IT taster
events in May each year. Older people are a significant proportion of the current 12.5
million digitally excluded and make up 39% of the six million socially and digitally
excluded adults. Public libraries have an important role in reducing this digital divide.
44% of libraries offer regular one to one support or group sessions specifically aimed at
supporting older people to get online. Last year 400 of the 1,000 Silver Surfers Day
events took place in public libraries and the MLA is working with Digital Unite to
encourage even greater library support for Silver Surfers Day 201057.
Get Online Day
Get Online Day, run by UKOnline Centres, is an annual campaign to communicate the
benefit of getting online and offering support through UKOnline Centres to develop
digital skills.

700 events took place in October 2009 which included 29% of library services. The MLA
research on the role of public libraries in supporting digital participation, January 2010,
found that an additional 67% of library services would be interested in supporting Get
Online Day in future, demonstrating the pivotal role of public libraries in supporting
digital inclusion58.

Proposal 27: The Government expects that from April 2011 all library services will
provide free internet access to users as part of their Library Offer to the public.
Government will, under section 8(2)(b) of the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964,
make an (affirmative) Order preventing libraries from charging for internet access. DCMS
will ensure that there will be no net additional costs to local authorities in line with the
Government’s new burdens procedures.

Proposal 28: Government recommends that all library services provide support and
advice for users wanting to get online as part of their Library Offer to the public.

Proposal 29: Libraries should engage with UK Online for practical support and are
encouraged to bid for funding for projects to help get one million additional people
online over the next 3 years59.

Proposal 30: Government recommends that libraries use the myguide tool to support
the Government’s digital inclusion target for getting one million additional people
online over the next 3 years60.

Proposal 31: Local leaders should consider how they can use internet access in libraries
and UKOnline Centres as a means of allowing access to online public services.

Proposal 32: Local Authorities should actively consider investing in JANET, the
education online network, to provide high speed broadband access in public libraries.

16. E-books and e-lending
There are new and exciting opportunities around digital lending. With the launch of a
number of different e-reading devices, digital reading is growing in the public
consciousness where downloadable audio books are already fully established. Libraries
must have the freedom to experiment with these new services and test out the market
for new and established library users. Currently 14 library services offer e-book services
in England with more planning to launch shortly. All lend for free.
Although media commentators are fond of setting up an opposition between printed
and digital books, there is no suggestion that e-books will drive out our nation’s passion
for printed books or that libraries will be delivered only in the online space. E-books will
enable library services to remain relevant in a market where people are using mobile
devices to access information and entertainment and will provide a new opportunity to

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

reach people who may not visit their local library building regularly, but who would like
to borrow e-books from home. A large number of respondents to the consultation
suggested that it is important to extend to e-book loans the principle of ‘free at the
point of demand’. The Government believes that e-book lending is likely to form a key
24/7 public service in the future with public library services being accessed from home
and on the move as well as in library buildings, and will therefore initiate changes to
secondary legislation to guarantee e-book loans are free.
Currently, most of the e-content bought by libraries is in copyright and libraries buy it
from the publisher or third party suppliers with the explicit purpose of lending it to the
public. When libraries purchase e-book content they buy a time-limited licence for use.
Most e-book contracts are between 1-3 years and if the contract is not renewed the
content disappears from the virtual library shelf. Contracts for use of content are
negotiated on an individual basis with either publishers directly or third-party suppliers
who negotiate terms of use with publishers and bundle deals for library services.

Current e-book arrangements in libraries
There are currently two methods of e-book access – Download and Online. Both are in
file formats compatible with most PCs and Macs and most e-book readers. They are
not compatible with e-book readers that operate proprietary formats, such as the
Amazon Kindle.
Downloads (e.g. Overdrive): Downloading schemes are currently the most common
form of e-book supply from libraries. The user enters their library card number and a
unique PIN code for access. Users are able to read the book on e-book readers which are
not networked (e.g. Sony e-reader) by downloading onto them. The scheme employs
DRM (digital rights management), so the file destroys itself after 3 weeks. Files employ a
single user access model but if multiple licenses (i.e. copies) are bought they can be
borrowed concurrently, each on a single user basis.
Online access (e.g. Bloomsbury): Online arrangements for e-book lending are less
common at present. E-books are not ‘lent’ in the traditional way and not downloaded –
these e-books are accessed online as if they were a reference work via the same
password system as for e-book downloads. The library service pays a subscription based
on population, which allows multiple user access to the copy when they are online. It is
limited by the quality of the network connection the user has which will determine
whether they have an uninterrupted link when reading. Currently e-book readers are not
networked, so cannot be used to access these e-books but it may become popular as
more networked devices (eg the iPad) become more prevalent.

New legislation around digital lending
To extend the options available to readers by ensuring that libraries can loan non-print
books easily, Government has included a clause in the Digital Economy Bill which will
remove the need for time consuming and complicated negotiations between library
authorities and rights-holders for permission to provide digital lending services in library
premises. Libraries will be protected from infringement of copyright when rights are
instead protected under the Public Lending Right Act 1979.
To ensure that libraries are not able to provide the public with unlimited access to an
author’s work (which would undermine commercial business models) the clause only
extends Public Lending Right (PLR) to audiobook and e-book files downloaded within

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

library premises and defines digital lending as files made available for a limited period
only. It will restrict lending to one loan per copy of the electronic work held by the
library unless the library has purchased permission to lend the work to more than one
person at any one time. These are the same terms on which print format books are
currently lent by public libraries.
By introducing this change, we hope to achieve a more flexible and less bureaucratic
mechanism for libraries to lend audiobooks and e-books without needing to rely on
third party suppliers. The detail of the new arrangements will be finalised in secondary
legislation but will not interfere with the arrangements already in operation or
opportunities for libraries to develop other arrangements for digital delivery with
publishers and booksellers.
Proposal 33: Government recommends that libraries assess the opportunity and
demand for e-book lending in their community, and develop strategies.

Proposal 34: Government expects e-books to be loaned for free. Government will under
section 8(2)(b) of the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964, make an (affirmative)
Order preventing libraries from charging for e-books lending of any sort including
remotely.

Proposal 35: DCMS will work with stakeholders to develop the secondary legislation for
the extension of the Public Lending Right to non print books to enable simple, cost
effective and easy to use arrangements for all public libraries.

17. Digital Content and engagement
Digital content and networks bring with them new ways to communicate and engage
with customers. Many libraries take advantage of the Reference Online service brokered
by the MLA61 and all library services already have a web presence. Consistent with the
Public Data principles in Putting the Frontline First: Smarter Government62, all libraries
should publish information about their services in a free, open and re-useable form
including their location, opening hours and catalogues.
Despite great potential and customers’ high expectations, local authorities and library
services are rarely early adopters of new technologies. 92% of respondents to the
consultation believe that libraries should be using Web 2.0 while acknowledging that
local authority network security policies often restrict their ability to do so. Consultation
responses suggest this may be because authorities are cautious about investing in
resources to develop relatively new and untested services. The majority of respondents
favoured a national catalogue, though some concerns were raised about the resources
required to deliver this project.
There is a need for greater shared awareness about emerging technologies, testing and
learning lessons about implementation and ensuring value for money. Success will
depend on the ability of library services to talk constructively with local IT and legal
departments, to make the case for change.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

And there are huge opportunities for libraries to consider – many libraries already use
email and text alerts, library applications and innovative web content like links to
reading materials are achievable and inexpensive opportunities. For instance, in Leicester
the desktop of all the libraries’ public computers are used to showcase library or local
partner initiatives, which significantly increases attendance. Partners have now started
to pay the library for a place on the public desktop. The service sends 14,000 emails a
month to library members about events and book reviews and also partner promotions.
They also send texts for requests and overdue reminders instead of posting letters
whenever possible. The service uses Youtube to advertise events and has used Web 2.0
technology to develop an events calendar for libraries using free Google tools.
At a time when public services are encouraging citizens to engage with online content
and services it is important that libraries provide a compelling offer to their users,
especially in attracting young people to use libraries.

Digital Library Licensing Service
MLA is working with JISC Collections and public library staff to provide public libraries with
high quality digital content to support lifelong learning. The new content will build on the
resources already available through MLA’s Reference Online service63. The digital resources
will be available to members of the public using public access PCs within public libraries,
offsite via secure authentication log ins and to library staff to support their work with
library users. JISC Collections are currently working with publishers to negotiate reduced
subscription rates to digital content identified by librarians as important and relevant to
their users. This will range from e-books, genealogy and family history resources, multi ­
media reference works and online databases. Subscription rates will be based on a price
banding model which provides both value for money and has no restrictions on numbers
of users for each resource. All resources will be procured under local and European
procurement regulations and agreed standards including access management.

Proposal 36: Government recommends that library services use digital technologies to
enhance and complement their existing offer and move towards providing a 24/7
partnership with other services, such as publishers, commercial providers and academic
libraries and institutions, the NHS and other e-government services. In the very near
future, library services should aim to have an integrated digital and physical public offer.

Proposal 37: When money becomes available, the strategic body for libraries will
develop a national online library catalogue for library users, building on the established
Unity UK staff-facing catalogue.

Proposal 38: Government recommends that all libraries allow access for users to social
networking sites which are valuable communication tools and part of our cultural
infrastructure. 86% provide access at present.

Proposal 39: The strategic body for libraries will bring together a national consortium of
stakeholders including technologists, publishers, librarians, local authorities and
academics to develop a digital innovation strategy for public libraries.

63

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Chapter 6
Aim: to demonstrate to citizens, commentators and politicians that libraries are
still relevant and vital
One of the great strengths of the public library service is its influence and impact on a
multitude of social and governmental priorities – on literacy, health and well-being, pre­
school children’s development, informal adult learning and digital inclusion. Because of
this pervasive impact across such a broad range of services, in order to demonstrate and
amplify the impact and value of the service there is an ongoing and collective challenge
to make the vital links to national and local priorities which will ensure public libraries
are integral to planning and delivery.

18. Making connections to other local services and policy priorities
Modern library services do not operate independently. They collaborate locally with a
broad range of public, private and third sector partners because they work best when
integrated with these services. The Funding Innovation Reference Group for this review
recognised and debated the opportunities for a library to be a ‘shop window’ for the
council in every community and the best local leaders are already well aware of the
opportunities offered by the library service for delivering on local priorities. The leading
heads of service are skilful in shaping initiatives for targeting particular audiences or
policies, and, as discussed in chapter 3, accessing funding streams to meet local
challenges. A number of respondents to the consultation explained how public libraries
are effective in engaging with hard to reach groups.
An example of this is the Reading Agency’s Six Book Challenge which encourages less
confident adults to read for pleasure by providing incentives and recognising their
achievement with certificates if they read six books. In 2009 the scheme was delivered
by 121 library authorities in England in partnership with FE colleges, prisons and trade
unions and more than 9000 people took part. The scheme was found to increase learner
confidence in reading, raise literacy rates and increase use of the library service.64
Around a quarter of respondents to the consultation felt that a lot of local authorities
were already communicating library initiatives effectively and contributing to other local
initiatives. Respondents mentioned a multitude of policy priorities where libraries play a
part – lifelong learning and literacy, online access, health services, links to services for
children, families, schools and the curriculum, services for the unemployed and benefits
services, work on community safety and with local police, links to Local travel and
transport services, green initiatives and rural outreach work. The table at Appendix B
illustrates a broad list of examples of partnerships between public libraries, other local
authority services and external partners.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Home Library Service
In Essex, the home library service visits people who are unable to reach the library
because of disability, age or long-term illness. Volunteers deliver books, CDs, DVDs and
information to customers in their homes, and chat to them about reading. When asked
what they got out of the home library service, people talked about the benefits of social
contact, stimulation and meeting new people. One person said “Without it, life wouldn’t
be so interesting. I’d miss out on a good friend. I look forward to her visits” and another
“I’d miss it greatly, his chats – it’s a lifeline.”
In Birmingham the home library service visits 2,000 people in their homes each
month, as well as calling at 230 residential care homes and sheltered accommodation
units. As well as lending books, music and DVDs, the library promotes the Stay Well 65
scheme. A partnership between Health Exchange CEC Limited, a social enterprise, and
Birmingham City Council which assesses older people’s needs and puts them in touch
with the benefits and services they’re entitled to. Library staff raise awareness of this
scheme among the people they visit and take laptops out with them to help older
people fill in the online forms.
The majority of those responding on this point in the consultation thought more could
be done to communicate the potential of libraries and drive effective partnerships. In
order to improve, some library services still need to embrace this agenda, challenge their
traditional delivery models and work with one another and other public, private and
third sector partners.
In 2003 Framework for the Future identified the importance of libraries making
connections to national programmes and interpreting them locally, and that theme still
prevails in 2010. The consultation responses also suggested that national government
could do more to draw out the connections to national policies and the value of public
libraries to multiple agendas.
There are a number of national policies already highlighting the library role:
• A partnership between libraries and NHS Choices (the comprehensive online
information service about the NHS): Libraries’ collections of printed material on a
wide variety of health and lifestyle topics and the availability of free or low cost
internet access make them an ideal place for people to research their condition,
dispense their information prescriptions or to book their health appointments online.
Government recognises the valuable impact libraries can have on health and will be
delivering a campaign promoting public libraries via doctors surgeries and other health
outlets. The Department of Health has developed free online training for library staff
around helping people to use the NHS Choices website to get advice about lifestyle
issues like smoking, drinking and exercise or to find and use health services in England.
• Libraries’ role in informal adult learning: Public libraries were recognised as playing
a key role in supporting individuals, families and communities to learn throughout life
in the Learning Revolution White Paper published in March 200965. The White Paper
identified the wider benefits of informal adult learning in building cohesive and
confident communities, promoting health and well-being and supporting an
increasingly ageing population to stay active, independent and fulfilled. Public libraries
are engaging local spaces that offer access to a wide range of free resources that

65

http://www.dius.gov.uk/skills/engaging_learners/informal_adult_learning/~/media/publications/
L/learning_revolution

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

encourage people to continue learning throughout their lives. They play a significant
role in supporting people who would not otherwise be able to participate in online
learning opportunities by offering a, largely free, community internet service. They are
ideally placed to support a thriving culture of lifelong learning to become established
in communities. Local authorities, in their new role as lead accountable bodies for
informal adult learning, will have the opportunity to commission a broader range of
learning opportunities for their local communities linked to local priorities. Public
libraries, in partnership with other public and third sector bodies, can play a clear role
in opening up access to a wide range of learning opportunities and should be
integrated into the adult learning plans that lead accountable bodies will be tasked
with developing.
Proposal 40: Government recommends that all library authorities consider connections
to local policy priorities, innovate around their service provisions to align the libraries’
work with local needs and local priorities. Eg. Raising education standards and narrowing
gaps in attainment between different groups in the local population.

Proposal 41: Local authority leaders should actively consider how their library service
could contribute effectively to other local services. E.g. services for children, schools
and families.

Proposal 42: Connections to other services and policy priorities should be a criteria
included in the accreditation and peer review schemes.

Proposal 43: Local authority chief executives should champion the partnership agenda
for libraries, encouraging relationships with the private and third sectors as well as those
between libraries and other public services or institutions – for instance early years and
children’s centres, schools and their libraries; and libraries in further and higher
education – to deliver improved services and greater efficiencies, particularly through
co-location and joint back office functions.

Proposal 44: Local authorities should ensure they consider cross boundary working for
libraries to improve service delivery and efficiency.

Proposal 45: DCMS will advocate across Whitehall about the contribution libraries can
make to a broad range of government priorities. This will help improve access to funding
streams and encourage government to use library services to deliver a broad range of
outcomes.

19. Improving Data and research
If we are to understand the value of libraries we must research and analyse their take up
and their impact. To examine how libraries can contribute to meeting local priorities as
set out in the new model of impact (Appendix A), library services need a radical change
in data and research collection. Data exists at national level but may not be being used
by local decision makers and practitioners effectively; national and local research
initiatives have been undertaken without sufficient coordination and small scale local
evaluations and research have limited application nationally.

47

48

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Data: Many of the consultation responses raised concerns about the type of data we are
collectively using, and a number of library authorities expressed frustration that local
statistics are extremely positive whilst the national picture does not reflect those
changes. While measuring book issues and visits were still felt to be relevant, there was a
general desire among respondents for more outcome/impact focused monitoring.
Customer satisfaction was also felt to be an important measure and a number of
respondents asked for better measurement of digital participation.
CIPFA Statistics: CIPFAstats are the independent source of data about local government
services. Established as a partnership between local authorities and CIPFA, the annual
public library statistics have been collected for many decades and present a consistent
picture of library use as evidenced by loans, acquisitions, visits etc. They are used by
library authorities as a management information tool in benchmarking and self
assessment. The data is collected from local authorities annually at the end of the
financial year. Validity checks can delay publication of the data but from next year CIPFA
aim to publish data nationally in December.
As set out on page 22, to see if we could improve our knowledge and understanding,
DCMS included some questions about library use and non-use in an Omnibus survey.
When funding becomes available CIPFA will look to evaluate ‘alternative’ use of the
library service that would look to better track a visitor’s journey through a library. From
this, questions would be developed to more effectively collect valuable information
relating to digital technology, use of the internet / e-books and services provided by
libraries outside their traditional scope such as crèches, reading groups etc.
DCMS Taking Part Survey: The DCMS Taking Part Survey measures the percentage of
the population using public libraries. It comprises face to face interviews and provides
both national and regional figures for library participation, including a picture of usage
outside the library premises such as website use, home visits, outreach work and mobile
library attendance. The DCMS Taking Part Survey measures library use for leisure
purposes – the DCMS Public Service Agreement (PSA) target – and therefore excludes
visits for the purpose of academic study or paid work. The survey shows an increase in
the proportion of children using libraries but a year on year decline in adult use. This is
illustrated by Graphs 3 and 4 on pages 21 and 22.
This concurs with CIPFA data for the same period showing that the number of visits and
the number of adult book issues have declined in England. Between 2001/02 and
2005/06, however, CIPFA statistics showed a short-term rise in visits to library premises,
but accompanied by a consistent drop in the number of book issues. All of this
illustrates the need for different data on library usage in order to unravel the nuances in
these trends so that we can understand more clearly who visits public libraries, how
often, and what they do there.
Government will review the data collected to ensure it is fit for purpose with the
following changes:
Proposal 46: From 2011 the DCMS Taking Part survey will also cover visits to libraries
for the purpose of paid work or academic study as a discrete element. This will provide
consistency for the survey and allow the figures to be amalgamated or used separately
and can still respond to the DCMS PSA target.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Proposal 47: From 2011 DCMS will include the questions from its Omnibus survey –
including those on use of library computers – in the DCMS Taking Part survey to develop
an ongoing picture about what people use libraries for and what library services might
be attractive to non users.

Proposal 48: The Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) Place
Survey provides information on people’s perceptions of their local area and the local
services they receive. DCMS will analyse the results of this survey alongside DCMS and
CIPFA surveys in order to correlate library membership/use with resident satisfaction
with the local area. The more we know about library users and non-users the more
confident we can be about steps we might take to improve library services and increase
participation.

National Indicator for Libraries
National Indicator 9 measures adult public library use. Only ten local authorities
currently take up this Indicator and a number of respondents to the review suggested
that it should be expanded to also include children’s use of libraries as well.
The Government has sympathy with this argument and recognises the key role that
libraries play in children’s development. However, the national indicators themselves will
not change during the current Local Area Agreement (LAA) period and future national
indicators may have a different measurement method than the current Active People
survey. At the next review of national indicators, Government will consider whether
extending the library indicator to children’s attendance is beneficial and represents value
for money.
Proposal 49: Government recommends that library authorities should analyse how
their work feeds into the full range of their local authority’s National Indicators and
ensure that their contribution is recognised and aligned with the wider work of the
local authority.

Proposal 50: DCMS will work with the Department for Communities and Local
Government (CLG) to develop new measures for any future iteration of the National
Indicator Set, which fully demonstrates and robustly captures the contribution that a
modernised library service can make to delivering local outcomes.

Evidence and Research
The library workforce knows that libraries change lives, help learning and improve
community cohesion. The Capturing Impact Reference Group for this review and the
majority of those responding to this issue in the consultation identified the importance
of measuring impact on library users. If we are to convince local and national leaders,
and partner organisations of the value of public libraries we must produce evidence
which connects library use to local and national priorities. A number of respondents felt
that there is already a good body of research of impact but the Government considers
that the majority of research projects are not sufficiently evidenced to make a forceful
case to local or national decision makers.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

However, there are a number of exceptions where evidence of impact is robust. In
November 2008 DCMS and its Capturing Impact Reference Group commissioned BOP
Consulting to undertake a study of the existing evidence base on the impact of public
libraries. The resulting report, Capturing the Impact of Libraries was published by DCMS in
March 200966. This research confirmed that public libraries contribute to a number of
policy priorities. For example, nearly all libraries participate in The Reading Agency’s
Summer Reading Challenge (SRC) which motivates children aged 4 to 12 to read six
library books during the school summer holiday. 725,000 children took part in SRC in
2009 and evidence suggests that most make gains in motivation, in achievement as
readers and in the scope of their reading experience67. Similarly 78% of Bookstart co­
ordinators who distribute Bookstart packs in nearly every local authority in the country
are funded by library services68. Bookstart has been found to impact positively on
parental reading habits and children’s progress in early years69.
The BOP consultancy report points to strong correlations between literacy levels and a
variety of physical and mental health and well being outcomes70. For instance, The
Reader Organisation’s Get Into Reading initiative, (in which Wirral Library Service is a
partner) has been found to have significant potential to increase feelings of well-being
in participants71. Links between libraries and a number of other public policy agendas are
also identified in the BOP report. Libraries’ ability to engage with excluded groups, such
as refugees and asylum seekers or children in care72, can contribute to building stronger
and safer communities, for example.
Libraries’ work with preschool children – through Bookstart Rhymetime, Baby Bounce
and storytime sessions particularly – makes a valuable contribution to language and
literacy development. Research has shown that these are accurate predictors of
educational attainment later in the life of the child73.
Despite these valuable examples, the impact of libraries is not often evaluated
effectively. This is predominantly because the projects being appraised are often pilots
with small sample groups, because baselines against which to monitor improvement are
not available, or because the studies are limited in their reach.
Government recognises the need for more co-ordination of the research agenda:
Proposal 51: DCMS will use Understanding Society – the largest Panel Study in the
world which explores the socio-economic circumstances and attitudes of 100,000
individuals in 40,000 British households – to provide longitudinal evidence. We will build
on the Panel Study evidence by running a small longitudinal study with respondents to
the DCMS Taking Part Survey in order to gain an ongoing understanding of the long
term impact of library participation.

The modernisation review of public libraries: A policy statement

Proposal 52: DCMS and the strategic Library body will bring together partners who
have a research interest (universities, third sector bodies etc) as a consortium to develop
a cross sectoral approach to measuring impact.

Proposal 53: As part of wider evidence work across the cultural sector and using the
evidence available, DCMS-led CASE programme is exploring ways to detect and measure
links between library engagement and perceptions of wellbeing. This work will be
published in the coming spring. For more information about the programme go to
www.culture.gov.uk/case.

Proposal 54: The Reading Agency and Loughborough University Library & Information
Statistics Unit (LISU) will this year conduct a major new project looking at the contribution
public libraries are making to the health and wellbeing of the communities they serve.
DCMS will ensure that any outcomes of the CASE work feed into this project 74.
