Background
Public Service Agreement targets
Following the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) in 1998, the Government
set new priorities for public spending with significant extra resources in key
services. The Government also made a commitment to link this extra investment to
modernisation and reform, to raise standards and improve the quality of public
services. The White Paper, Public Services for the Future: Modernisation, Reform,
Accountability, (December 1998) and its supplement published in March 1999,
delivered this commitment by publishing for the first time measurable targets for
the full range of the Government’s objectives.
The 1998 CSR took an important step forward in delivering improvements in
services through the introduction of Public Service Agreements. Public Service
Agreements (PSAs) set out each department’s aim, objectives and key outcomebased targets. They form an integral part of the spending plans set out in Spending
Reviews. At each subsequent Spending Review (2000, 2002 and 2004), PSAs have
been refined and developed in order that departments continue to focus on the
priorities that the Government is committed to deliver.
This Autumn Performance Report (APR) provides supplementary information for
the period up to October 2005 on the progress of the Department for Culture Media
and Sport (DCMS) towards its PSA performance targets in SR2002 and SR2004.

Efficiency Review
The Efficiency Review was announced by the Chancellor in his Budget speech in
2003. It was independently led by Peter Gershon, then Head of the Office of
Government Commerce, and took a radical look at the way government does its
business. The Review aimed to:
G

release major resources from activities which can be undertaken more
efficiently into frontline services that meet the public’s highest priorities;
and

G

reduce the bureaucracy faced by frontline professionals and free them
better to meet the needs of their customers.

In DCMS, the efficiency programme will deliver:
G

£262m of efficiency gains from DCMS, its non-departmental public
bodies (NDPBs), and the culture and leisure sectors of Local Authorities
by 2008;

G

600 posts relocated outside London and the South East by 2010; and

G

a reduction in headcount in DCMS of 27 posts by 2008.

The Plan sets out the Department’s achievements, goals and the practical steps we
will take to achieve them in the years ahead. In the Plan, we make 10 commitments
covering the key areas where the Department, working together with our partners
in our sponsored bodies, central Government, local government, the voluntary and
private sectors, can make a difference.

Taking Part Survey
The DCMS, working in partnership with our NDPB partners, has commissioned
the “Taking Part” survey to improve our knowledge base of users and non-users of
our sectors.
The key objectives of this project are to:
G

provide a robust measurement of the Department’s Public Service
Agreement (PSA) target 3;

G

meet the key data requirements of stakeholders concerning participation,
attendance and attitudes at a national level; and

G

provide data comparable across different sectors.

The dataset will allow robust measurement of the Department’s PSA target on
increasing participation and attendance amongst priority groups. In the past, the
DCMS has not been able to report on progress against similar targets with the same
level of confidence that will be provided by “Taking Part”. “Taking Part” will also
provide the data enabling DCMS, its NDPBs, and the wider cultural and sporting
communities to develop better research and analysis across our sectors.

Performance Information
For each of the Department’s PSA and efficiency review targets there is at least one
performance indicator against which progress is monitored. Associated with each
indicator is one or more projects that will drive the attainment of that particular
indicator. Those projects are brought together under a programme, which
coordinates and drives the delivery of the overall target.
Performance information on target indicators is set out in the following
Performance Tables.
Baselines and data analysis methodologies are detailed in the Departmental
Technical Notes.
A summary assessment of each indicator is made using the following approaches:
TERMS FOR FINAL ASSESSMENTS OF TARGETS

Target achieved by the target date – must not be used
before the target end-date unless there is no possibility
at all of subsequent slippage
For older open-ended targets where the target level has
been met and little would be achieved by continuing to
report the same information indefinitely. (In using this
term it should be made clear that a final assessment is
being given)
Where a target has two or more distinct elements, and
some – but not all – have been achieved by the target
date
Where a target was not met or met late
This should only be used where it was not possible to
assess progress against the target during its lifetime or

Productivity is estimated for each of the three industries by dividing gross value
added by total employment. Gross value added and total employment are
estimated from the Office of National Statistics Annual Business Inquiry.
Baselines and targets are reported under two headings; “Tourism and Leisure
related Industries” and “Creative Industries”. Targets take the form of annual
percentage increases in the productivity figures higher than those for the service
sector as a whole.
PSA4 Improve significantly the value for money of the department’s sponsored
bodies, measured by a matrix of NDPB indicators.
Indicator:

Not yet assessed

A range of performance indicators for two groups of sponsored bodies – the
national museums and galleries and the Lottery distributors – will be collected
and supplemented with text to explain any factors beyond an organisation’s
control that may explain variances. The outturn figures and text will be used to
assess overall effectiveness and efficiency in delivering objectives.

Latest outturn data
This target is measured through schools within a School Sport Partnership. There are now 411
School Sport Partnerships in operation, covering 80 per cent of schools. All schools will be in a
School Sport Partnership by 2006.
Overall, 69 per cent of pupils within a School Sport Partnership took part in at least two hours of
high quality PE and school sport in a typical week in 2004-05. There has been a particular
increase in the primary sector, with 64 per cent of pupils (in primary partnership schools) taking
part in two or more hours of high quality PE and school sport. This compared to 53 per cent in
2003-04, an increase of 13 percentage points. In secondary partnership schools, 75 per cent of
pupils took part in two or more hours of high quality PE. This compared to 73 per cent in
2003-04, an increase of two percentage points.
Ofsted judged that, in 2003-04, the quality of teaching was good or better in 62 per cent of
lessons in primary schools and 76 per cent of lessons in secondary schools.

aged 20 and above from priority groups.
Indicator
1. Increase attendance and
participation by
underrepresented groups in
arts events.
Targets: Increase attendance
by 3% and participation
by 2%

Project Description

Progress

The package of interventions
underpinning this objective
will be delivered by Arts
Council England (ACE),
managed and monitored
through the Funding
Agreement with DCMS. ACE
will work through three main
funding channels: regularlyfunded organisations (RFOs),
grants for the arts (open
application funds) and flexible
funds (which are not open to
application)

Slippage

Data to report on the targets
are drawn from annual
surveys of attendance,
participation and attitudes to
the arts. In 2001-2, 2003-4
and 2005-6, the sample
was/will be drawn from the
general population and will be
used to report on disabled
people and socially excluded
people. Black and minority
ethnic groups were/will be
reported on in 2002-3 and
2004-5 using a specially
designed survey.

• Based on the latest survey
information, only one of the
six targets is currently on
target to be met. Previous
data indicated the targets
would be met.
• The Minister for Culture has
oversight of the project. He
has asked for a remedial
action plan to be put in place
• DCMS is working with ACE
to put in place new reporting
procedures on the
programmes being funded
by ACE for SR2004 target
• Evidence suggests individual
programme elements are
impacting on priority groups
but at a slower rate then
expected. Increases are
unlikely to impact on this
target, but should do
increasingly on SR2004

PSA target 3

Improve the productivity of the tourism, creative and leisure industries
The DCMS seeks to support this objective at a microeconomic level, with projects designed to
impact on its sponsored industries. These take two forms: research aimed at understanding drivers
of performance in the industries; and policies informed by the research and other evidence.
The impact of these projects will be measured and assessed through analysis of the contribution
the Tourism and Leisure and creative industries make to UK productivity. This will be a long term
project. The base year for the data on productivity performance is 2002, and the trends in
productivity up to and including 2002 are shown in the graph below.
The performance of each of the projects supporting the target is reported below.

Progress

Tourism Marketing

Met

There is a direct link between promotional work to increase
visitor spend and increased productivity. The impact first of
Foot and Mouth disease and then of the attacks of
September 11 2001 led to a significant reduction in overseas
visitors and spending. The domestic tourism market also
declined, although it is more resilient and quicker to recover
from downturns. These events highlighted the particular
fragility of the inbound market and the need to develop a
more sustainable industry.

• Domestic marketing plan
prepared September 2003

Two key projects were devised to deliver the required
reforms:
• The reform of the tourism support infrastructure – see
PSA4 below

• 2003-04 30:1 return on
investment achieved
• 2004-05 initial figures indicate
29:1 investment achieved
• Delivery in longer term rests on
DCMS’ ability to influence other
departments, the local and
regional partners and the
industry
• Overarching project framework
in place

• Establishment of a renewed focus on professional
marketing within the new body.

industries against the whole economy and service sector. The figures are shown as an index with a
base year of 2002 (the base year agreed in the last spending round).
Our PSA target requires productivity improvements above the service sector as a whole. This has
not been met. From figure 1 it is clear that while productivity in the Creative Industries and all
service sectors improved at broadly the same rate, productivity in the tourism related and other
leisure industries fell. Table 1, below, sets out the figures in more detail.

Despite the successful conclusion of a number of our projects productivity in the
tourism sector has fallen. Productivity is measured as gross value added divided by
total employment (see Technical Note for more detail on definitions and
methodology). The fall in tourism productivity is driven by a 2% increase in
employment while GVA has remained broadly constant.
There may be two potential causes of these trends. The first is a change in the
composition of foreign visitors. The second may be related to the measure of
employment.
G

The average expenditure per inbound visitor fell by 1% in 2003 potentially
causing a reduction in income generated per employee.

G

Employment is measured as the total number employed regardless of the
number of hours they work. It does not, therefore, take account of
switching between full and part time employment. It is possible that the
tourism sector has shifted towards more part time and flexible working as
a result of the uncertainty caused by incidents such as 9/11, SARS and
foot and mouth disease.

Data is collated from ONS’s Annual Business Inquiry (ABI). For more information
please see www.statistics.gov.uk/abi/gackground_info.asp. ONS data are produced
to National Statistics standards, and under the National Statistics Codes of Practice
and its protocols.
The data have some limitations when used to examine the reported changes in
productivity:
G

At low levels of disaggregation the estimates from the ABI may fluctuate
as a result of the sampling process and the complex way that Value Added
is estimated. As a result trend changes are likely to be more robust than
year on year changes.

G

Firms are classified by their main activity. The value added from any
secondary activity will be allocated to their main category. This could lead
to under or over estimates in some cases.

G

To make meaningful comparisons across time it is necessary to ensure
prices are constant. GVA figures are all expressed in 2002 prices, and an
average annual GDP deflator is used.

16

G

GVA and employment from Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes
are split to make the DCMS estimates of productivity. Constant
proportions are used for tourism sectors such as bars, restaurants etc and
Creative Industries.

G

The Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), used for Office for
National Statistics business surveys, covers businesses that are registered
for VAT and will not include small businesses whose turnover is below the
VAT threshold and who are not registered for VAT. The register will
include businesses running a PAYE scheme. This means that coverage of
businessess in some sectors of the creative industries will be limited.

DCMS has contributed to the international review of SIC codes (‘Operation 2007’).

Performance Report PSA 4
PSA4 Target
Improve significantly the value for money of the Department’s sponsored bodies,
measured by a matrix of NDPB indicators.
Under this PSA, a programme of work was devised to improve the value delivered
through our sponsored bodies by:
G

implementing targeted reform programmes for specific NDPBs where a
major and pressing need has been identified;

G

better aligning NDPB activity with DCMS priorities, through hold-back
and ring fencing of funds and new tighter funding agreements;

G

reforming the delivery of Lottery funds to ensure fairer and more costeffective distribution to all areas and communities throughout the UK;

G

improving our appointments function and the way in which we work with
the Boards of our NDPBs; and

G

identifying generic constraints on NDPB performance with which the
Department can help, including those relating to pay and the workforce.

Seven related, though distinct projects were set out in the DCMS 2004 APR;
progress against each is presented below.
Reform of British Library – Met early • 135 posts removed by end December 2004 (47
severance, 9 TUPE and 79 turnover) resulting in
savings of £2.7m per year
• Further savings of 40-55 posts programmed for 200405 with savings of an additional £1.1m per annum
• Structural and senior staff changes made
Reform of British Museum – Met early • 160 posts removed resulting in a net loss of 127 staff.
Cost savings of £6.8m per year
• Phase II of change programme to address internal
restructuring issues implemented. This will not deliver
large savings, but it will help to modernise the culture
of the museum
• Severance target secured
Reform of Sport England – Met early • Strategy clear, large scale reorganisation complete

Halt the year on year increase in obesity among children under 11 by 2010, in the
context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole.
Indicator
Prevalence of obesity as
defined by National BMI
percentile classification for
children aged between 2 and
10 years (inclusive) measured
through the Health Survey for
England. Baseline year is
weighted average for three
year period 2002-04.

Project Description

Progress

The prevalence of obesity has
trebled since the 1980s, and
well over half of all adults are
either overweight or obese –
almost 24 million adults.

Not yet assessed

If the number of obese
children continues to rise,
children will have a shorter
life expectancy than their
parents
Obesity and being overweight
increase the risk of the biggest
killer diseases, such as heart
disease, cancer and type 2
diabetes
If current trends continue, at
least a third of adults, a fifth
of boys and a third of girls
will be obese by 2020
In recognition of the
complexity of meeting this
public health challenge across
the fields of health, physical
activity/sport and education,
the target is shared by the
Department of Health, the
Department for Culture,
Media and Sport and the
Department for Education and
Skills.

• Complex delivery chain,
with a wide range of
delivery agents and
stakeholders nationally,
regionally and locally
• Delivery plan, including risk
register, milestones,
trajectories and trends being
finalised
• Analytical work has
identified which work
programmes will contribute
most to target, which are the
most cost effective and will
impact the most on the
children who are likely to be
obese in 2010
• Programme Board, Food &
Health Working Group and
Food & Drink Advertising
Forum all held, with
Physical Activity Working
Group to be confirmed.
Boards will review progress

Project Description

Progress

There is a trend towards
convenience in everyday life
which is threatening to make
us less active as a society.
About two thirds of men and
three quarters of women do
less than the recommended 30
minutes of moderate intensity

PSA target 4
By 2008, improve the productivity of the tourism, creative and leisure industries
The DCMS seeks to support this objective at a microeconomic level, with key
projects designed to impact on its sponsored industries. These take two forms:
research aimed at understanding drivers of performance in the industries; and
policies informed by the research and other evidence.
The impact of these projects will be measured and assessed through analysis of the
contribution that the Tourism and Leisure and creative industries make to UK
productivity. This will be a long term project. The base year for the data on
productivity performance is 2002, and the trends in productivity up to and
including 2002 are shown in the graph with comments on page 14.

Implementation of Gambling Act

On course

When implemented, the Gambling Act will replace most
existing gambling law. It will extend to the whole of Great
Britain. It puts in place an improved, more comprehensive
structure of gambling regulation, and creates a new
independent regulatory body the Gambling Commission.

• Gambling Commission
established and launched
October 2005

Currently, we are working towards 1 September 2007 as the
target date for full implementation of the Act. The main
tasks needed to be completed to meet this target are:
• Establishment of the Gambling Commission, its relocation
to Birmingham and the development of its approach to
regulation.
• Parliamentary approval for the secondary legislation
necessary for full implementation of the Act.
• Working with licensing authorities.
• Establishment of an independent advisory panel that will
provide advice to the Secretary of State about which
licensing authorities should have power to issue licences
for casinos.

Tourism

On Course

We are taking forward work with our delivery partners,
which will focus on investment, skills and competition,
innovation and enterprise. Resulting projects will be
complemented by a number of enabling programmes and
other activities which will provide us with the knowledge,
infrastructure and influence needed to underpin our
Programme. Projects will be evaluated in the light of their
conclusions.

• External events can impact on
tourism industry

The work is being managed as a programme because of the
complex interdependencies between the different projects.
Our overall success will be measured in terms of headline
tourism productivity increases. It will not be possible to
prove the cause and effect between one work programme
and a certain amount of productivity gain.

• Complex delivery chains and
interdependencies. Largely rests
on the ability to influence other
departments, local and regional
partners and the Industry
• Overarching delivery plan in
place, supported by individual
project plans
• Work on four strategic priority
areas (marketing/e-tourism,
quality, skills and data)
progressing through to 2008
• Further work to take place on
how to measure the impact of
DCMS interventions.
• Two year time lag before outturn
data

Creative Industries Projects

On Course

We are initially focusing on two priority projects that can do
most to increase productivity and so best deliver our PSA
target: the creative industries intellectual property rights
forum and the film co-production review. These projects are
supported by ongoing policy work that either seeks to
address productivity drivers across the sector or maintains a
fruitful Government dialogue with the film and music
sectors.

• Complex/long delivery chain –
sector mainly made up of small
businesses
• New strategic framework for
delivering increased productivity
in place. Current Intellectual
Property Rights and Film
projects sit within this
• Good progress on film treaty
project. Work in hand to agree
how to evidence impact of
treaties
• IPR project on track. Evaluation
of workstrand being discussed.
IP Forum possibly to take on
monitoring role
• Project Plan and governance
structure in place for current
projects
• Research and scoping underway
which will inform development

Project Summary

Progress

£114m efficiency gains target

On course

This work strand will maximize the level of savings, sharing
best practice to extend efficiency across the sector and
obtaining measurable and robust proposals from all bodies
to increase resources for front-line delivery.

• Efficiency is becoming
embedded throughout NDPBs.
The project has measurable and
robust proposals from all
strategic NDPBs and grantgiving bodies for how they will
meet or exceed their targets.

The workstand is largely being taken forward by NDPBs
themselves. It is supported by two DCMS-led projects:
• Funding Agreements to facilitate a more open relationship
with NDPBs, including details of the efficiency targets to
help embed efficiency further.
• Procurement: this project will deliver greater efficiency in
procurement through cooperation and collaboration with
DCMS sponsored bodies. It is promoting the use of best
practice and e-procurement across the wider DCMS
family.

• To ensure that efficiencies are
not made at the expense of
quality, balancing quality
measures such as customer
satisfaction, surveys and KPIs
are used. Further details are
included in the Department’s
Efficiency Technical Note.
• NDPBs provide data returns
every six months detailing
efficiency gains made in that
period.
• The new Funding Agreements
will be agreed by the end of
December 2005.
• The procurement project has
researched the needs of NDPBs,
and established a Procurement
Council of NDPBs to share best
practice and support less wellresourced bodies. The project
will take forward the
recommendations of the
National Audit Office report on
procurement in DCMS sectors.

Latest outturn data:
Interim data returns indicate that NDPBs have delivered approximately £34.2m of efficiency
gains in the period up to 30 September 2005.
