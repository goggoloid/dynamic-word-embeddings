Summary of responses
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) ran a targeted consultation
exercise from 14 January to 19 February 2016 and invited written stakeholder views
and opinions on the development of a UK Cultural Protection Fund. Comments and
suggestions were sought on the overall approach, priorities and principles of the
Fund, design and delivery, monitoring and evaluation and further practical
considerations relevant to the Fund. In addition DCMS held a series of consultative
workshops with stakeholders.
This paper summarises the 63 comprehensive consultation responses received as
well as the additional information gathered at the workshops which were well
attended. It also explains the approach DCMS and the British Council will take
following the consultation.

assesses the effectiveness of the online
consultation exercise.

The Fund’s purpose/vision
In 2015, the UK government announced its commitment to support targeted activity
aimed at the protection of cultural heritage, and the recovery from cultural
destruction in conflict zones. The government will contribute £30 million funding from
2016­17 to 2019­20 for a new, competitive grants based Cultural Protection Fund.
Around £3m of this funding has already been allocated to the British Museum’s Iraqi
Emergency Heritage Management programme, a pilot programme that was launched
in advance of the main Fund.
4

In the consultation, we set out details of the Fund’s purpose and the outcomes we
expect will occur as a result. Our objective is to help to create opportunities for
economic and social development through building capacity to foster, safeguard and
promote cultural heritage in conflict­ affected regions overseas. Activities operating
under the Fund will be expected to meet one at least of the Fund’s three outcomes:
cultural heritage protection; training and capacity building; and advocacy and
education.
The majority of respondents to the consultation agreed with these objectives and
outcomes. It was also suggested that the Fund’s work should seek to complement
wider development aims. DCMS has amended the Fund’s objective to make it clear
that projects under the Fund will create opportunities for both economic and social
development.
In the consultation, we also looked at examples of possible projects that could meet
the outcomes we want to achieve. Some consultation responses provided further
details of the type of projects a fund of this sort could support and an updated list of
these is provided at ​
Annex C​
.

Governance
The government wants the Fund to be governed by a long­term strategic approach in
order to meet its objectives and outcomes to ensure the efficacy and sustainability of
its impact.
Guiding principles for the Fund
The Fund will be underpinned by a set of guiding principles. These principles have been
informed by responses to the consultation and will apply to the Fund’s operation and
funded projects:
●

Complementarity:​
ensuring the work of the Fund and its outcomes complement
other contemporary cultural and development programmes, avoiding duplication
and ensuring that work is completed according to a long­term strategic approach.

●

Collaboration and partnership: ​
​
ensuring collaboration and partnership are at the
heart of work of the Cultural Protection Fund by working ​
in partnership with​
and ​
for
the benefit of ​
local communities. Consultation and advice will be sought from
multiple stakeholders including cultural bodies, government, security and civil
society organisations.

●

Evidence­based analysis:​
​
relevant knowledge and expertise will be sought out
and incorporated to inform appropriate analysis of the longer term potential cultural,
social and economic benefits as well as the short term need for protection and
preservation of cultural assets.

●

Best practice: ​
best practice and standards will underpin the Fund and all its work,
both from the cultural heritage and development sectors to ensure a meaningful
approach which is both technically relevant and sustainable.

5

● T
​ransparency, efficiency and value for money:​
ensuring the Fund and its
associated projects are managed efficiently, transparently and represent value for
money.

Although the majority of respondents to the consultation welcomed the proposed
principles for the Fund, we received valuable feedback on them. We have therefore
amended these principles for clarity and to ensure they reflect our commitment to a
long­term strategic approach, collaboration and partnership, local engagement,
sustainability and best practice.

Funding
An outline of the funding settlement is laid out in table II.

Over the lifetime of the Fund, the funding will be used to provide international
support for cultural heritage in global conflict zones. We define global conflict zones
as regions at risk of, experiencing, or recovering from conflict overseas. Specific
regional priorities will be determined under advice and according to need.
The funding allocated is Official Development Assistance (ODA) which means that
all work supported under the Fund must have the economic development and
welfare of developing countries as its main objective. Countries eligible to be
supported by ODA must be present on the Organisation for Economic Co­operation
and Development's (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of ODA
Recipients1.
It is clear from the consultation exercise that some in the heritage and academic
sectors have limited experience of this specific type of funding; so the British Council
will be providing guidance on working with ODA funding and the requirements
attached to this as part of the management of the Fund.

Management of the Fund and expertise
The British Council will take on the responsibility for the Fund’s design, operation
and funding allocated. The British Council will also be responsible for providing
advice on the Fund’s strategic direction informed by expertise and evaluation of the

Fund’s priorities and effectiveness to government. The British Council will continue to
work closely with DCMS as the government department with overall accountability
for cultural protection policy and funding.
The majority of respondents to the consultation agreed with the government’s
proposed approach. However, while the British Council’s international network and
relevant experience was welcomed, some concerns were raised about areas of
expertise that they appear to lack. Government agrees that drawing on a range of
expertise, particularly heritage expertise, is fundamental to the success of the Fund
and DCMS and the British Council will ensure that relevant expertise is incorporated
into the design and delivery of the Fund and grant management processes. As part
of the role in administering the Fund, the British Council will build in mechanisms to
access external expertise to support the grant awarding process and assessment of
applications. The full £30m of the Cultural Protection Fund will be available for work
aimed at cultural protection. The British Council are providing administrative
resources to support the management of the Fund.
The project to establish the Cultural Protection Fund is being supported by a
Steering Board made up of sector representatives and UK government officials. The
role of this board is to advise on the design and implementation work, provide a
degree of challenge and share learning and experience.

Grants process
During the consultation we sought views on various aspects of the grant
management process. The responses indicated that best practice included putting
the balance of due diligence on the application process and clearly indicated that it
was desirable to make both small and large grants available, as long as this was
proportionate to administrative considerations.
The British Council will lead on developing a suitable grant management strategy.
This will be informed by the consultation responses and by bringing in appropriate
external expertise. This expertise will include advice from key government
departments including FCO, DFID, the relevant departments of the devolved nations,
lessons learned from the British Museum’s pilot project, as well as seeking expertise
from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and other relevant stakeholders as
appropriate. It is expected that both small and large grants will be available and the
British Council will establish the size of these based on an assessment of views
expressed in the consultation and established best practice of existing grant funds,
for example those operated by HLF.
Year one of the Cultural Protection Fund
Year one of the Cultural Protection Fund will broadly follow the standard process and
cycle that will operate for the whole four years of the Fund. However, given the
shorter time frame for year one, the need to ensure an adequate knowledge base for
the Fund and to trial different approaches to ensure best practice, it is likely that the
approach to year one will differ partially to future years. In addition, there will only be
one grant application round for the 2015/16 financial year.
7

The geographical focus of the Fund in year one is confirmed as the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) region, specifically Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, The
Occupied Palestinian Territories, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and Yemen. This echoes the
views raised in consultation responses, which overall were supportive of our
indicated approach.
Years two, three and four
In subsequent years of the Fund two grant application rounds for large grants will run
in September and March for projects beginning April and October of the subsequent
financial year. For small grants a rolling small grant programme will review grant
applications quarterly (September, December, April and July).
A review and learning cycle will be built into the Fund as it is designed.
Operationally, this will include a review of the running of the Fund to ensure it
continues to meet its objective and remains effective and fit for purpose. Additionally,
DCMS will review the strategic direction for the Fund annually and this will include a
review of the geographical focus. Table III gives an overview of what the standard
grants process is expected to look like.

Applications
The information gathered from the consultation process will inform the British
Council’s design of the application process which will be based in existing best
practice, including that of HLF. The British Council is expected to ask applications to
meet specific requirements which are summarised on the following page.
Proposed selection requirements of the application process
Local engagement and need
All grant applications will need to demonstrate a strong element of engagement with the local
communities they will be operating in or who will be benefiting from the project including:
●

clear need for the project to be carried out and that the applicant is the body best placed
to fulfill this need

●

that the project has been developed in consultation with local people and that it will be
carried out with a local partner

●

that the project has been developed with consideration to similar existing programmes in
the same geographical area and that it is not duplicating existing work

Capacity​
­ Applicants will be expected to demonstrate: both financial and technical capacity,
proven expertise and capability in the proposed field of work, the capacity to carry out work in a
meaningful way with local communities as well as the ability to commence work in the specified
time period.
Security and equalities​
­ The British Council will seek expertise regarding gender and equalities
in order to develop a locally and sectorally appropriate gender and equalities policy for projects
under the Fund and will provide guidance on this for applicants. Applicants will be expected to
demonstrate how they are able to ensure the security of project staff and project beneficiaries.
Project management ​
­ Applicants will need to be able to give information about: financial
forecasts (including expected cash flows), project timelines and dates for key milestones,
monitoring and evaluation plans which highlight key indicators and meet the requirements of the
Fund.

Grant application guidance
The consultation highlighted the need for further clarification in specific areas as well
as where knowledge gaps in the sector mean that additional guidance should be
prepared. With this in mind, we expect that the British Council will be producing grant
application guidance which will set out:
● Parameters for ODA funding.
● Information on relevant legal obligations, policies and procedures and how
they apply to projects working under the Fund including risk management,
equalities, gender and ethical policies.
● Further detail on project eligibility.
9

Monitoring and evaluation
The consultation period demonstrated that a range of experience exists across the
relevant sectors in monitoring and evaluation of projects. The British Council and
DCMS will work together to build a coherent evaluation framework for the Cultural
Protection Fund through the development of a detailed Evaluation Plan. All grant
funded projects will be monitored by the British Council and expected to report at
regular intervals which will be set out in the grant guidance. Additionally, applicants
will need to include information on their plans for both monitoring and evaluation
during the application process. In turn DCMS will be monitoring the work of the
British Council and likewise will expect regular reports on the Fund.
Collaboration and learning
The British Council are considering an appropriate mechanism for information
sharing, including sharing of materials developed by projects to support collaboration
and learning throughout the lifetime of the Fund and beyond.

Next steps
Government is grateful to everyone who responded to the consultation. The British
Council is now designing the Fund which is due to open for applications in June
2016. The consultation responses and the additional information have been shared
with the British Council and will inform the Fund going forward.

Analysis of responses by question
Section 1: The proposal for a Cultural Protection Fund
Our vision
Section 1 of the consultation document set out the context and background of the
Cultural Protection Fund, stating the overarching objective, outcomes and a brief
overview of the short, medium and long term ambitions for the Fund. Question 1
sought validation for the overall vision and initial policy development.
|​
Q1: Do you agree or disagree with the proposed overall approach to the
Cultural
Protection Fund as outlined in Section 1?
|​
Q1a: Please provide any comments to explain your answer to Q1.
The majority (84%) of respondents answered affirmatively to this question and
agreed with the approach. Only 8% did not answer the question and the remaining
8% did not agree. Overall this endorsed our approach and the direction of travel for
the continued development of the Fund. However, in commenting on this question
many respondents included very useful information and guidance which we have
sought to capture throughout this response and in the themes identified at ​
Annex B.

Principles
|​
Q2: Do you agree or disagree with the principles of the Fund?
|​
Q2a: Please provide any comments to explain your answer to Q2.
The majority of respondents also agreed with the principles of the Fund. Out the 63
written responses, 53 (83%) agreed with the principles of the Fund, 9 did not answer
and only 1 respondent disagreed, demonstrating a broad acceptance of the
principles. However, respondents offered a range of additional useful comments on
these principles, for example highlighting the need for the principle of
complementarity, including in the context of existing social, economic and
environmental programmes. A significant number of respondents also highlighted
the need for collaboration internationally, regionally and locally between partners and
communities. In addition the need for a clear strategic vision was raised by many
consultees and this, with collaboration, local collaboration in particular, were themes
which reoccurred prominently throughout the consultation period. Supporting and
following best practice alongside collaboration were also referenced by a small group
of respondents. In raising the above points, some commented that there were
aspects of the principles in need of minor reinforcement and clarification. DCMS has
amended the principles accordingly.
11

Projects
|​
Q3: Table 1 provides a list of potential projects under each of the Fund
outcomes. Is there anything that we have not considered?
In response to this question, respondents included suggestions for types of projects
they considered had been omitted, and these have been, where appropriate,
included in the examples project list which was included in the consultation. A full
and updated list can be found at ​
Annex C.​
Although this list is not exhaustive, it
serves as a guide to the types of work applicants may request funding for and will
help inform the design of the Fund.
In addition to the types of projects that were considered to have been omitted,
respondents also provided helpful advice on where they thought efforts should be
concentrated. Chart II demonstrates which broad types of projects were given
emphasis by participants for inclusion in the Fund. As chart II demonstrates, a clear
emphasis was given to capacity building and training. Other areas for projects which
were frequently highlighted included: community engagement, projects to support
the development of the Fund, preventative protection projects, illicit trade and
intangible heritage.
The need for prevention and protection, community engagement, illicit trade of
cultural property and intangible heritage were also emphasised in the workshops. In
terms of community engagement, the need for collaboration across programmes and
for evidence of community engagement in both the applicant's experience and
content of their proposed programme were both identified as key by respondents
and this has been incorporated accordingly in the revised principles and design for
the application process. The matters of illicit trade and intangible heritage are more
complex given the Fund’s defined scope and ODA funding ­ projects seeking to work
with intangible heritage will be eligible where they relate to the first outcome of the
Fund, ‘Cultural Heritage Protection’, and to the support or creation of tangible
heritage. We envisage that the Fund has a significant potential to contribute towards
the tackling of illicit trade through encouraging and supporting projects to record and

document existing cultural heritage as well as potentially through advocacy and
education projects. However, as military and security activities are currently not
supported by ODA, significant aspects of work related to illicit trade will not be ODA
eligible and guidance will need to be available for applicants about what type of
projects seeking to tackle illicit trade of cultural objects in the MENA region would be
eligible under both the Fund and ODA requirements.

Section 2: Delivering the Fund
Section II of ​
Government Proposals to Protect Cultural Heritage Overseas ​
sought
views on more detailed aspects of the Fund where our approach was less defined
and would benefit from the experiences of others.

Administration of the Fund
|​
Q4: Please tell us about any examples of existing successful cultural heritage
protection initiatives operating in conflict zones in ODA eligible countries.
As part of the consultation, we were keen to gather information on existing cultural
heritage protection initiatives operating in conflict zones in ODA eligible countries to
help inform the direction of the Fund and aid complementarity. DCMS is grateful to
all those who provided examples of a broad range projects and initiatives and has
collated this data. In addition, DCMS has carried out an initial scoping exercise on
Cultural Protection work by country but given the enormity of this task as well as the
need for coordination, we consider that an important part of at least the first year of
the Fund will be to ensure that the grant criteria allows organisations to propose
research projects which can further the knowledge of the Fund.

Grant size
In the consultation we asked several questions regarding the size and value of
grants made under the Cultural Protection Fund.
|​
Q5: Should there be a minimum and maximum value for grant awards?
|​
Q5a: If yes to Q5, what would you recommend the minimum grant award to be
(in £)?
|​
Q5b: If yes to Q5, what would you recommend the maximum grant award to be
(in £)?
|​
Q6: Please provide any additional comments on question 5.
Analysis of consultation data on grant size and value demonstrated that there was
no clear direction as to the size of grants under the Fund, but did highlight a general
consensus that the shape of the grant funding will have a bearing on practical and
administrative considerations.

13

In response to question 5, less than half (46%) of all respondents answered ‘yes’,
there should be a minimum and maximum grant award, 39% said there should not
be a minimum or maximum grant award. Only 46% of all respondents recommended
a minimum grant figure (54% did not answer the question), however the majority
(72%) of those who did recommended a minimum grant figure suggested this should
be below £50,000. Only 43% of all respondents recommended a maximum grant
award (57% did not answer the question). The majority (70%) suggested maximum
grant award should be up to and including £3,000,000. The maximum grant amount
suggested was £5,000,000. Many additional comments on the grant process are
captured in the themes below. The information from both the written responses and
workshops has led DCMS to make several key conclusions regarding grant size and
value which will be taken into account in work following on from the consultation.
● Both small and large grants should be made available under the Fund
● Consideration should be given to a tiered approach. Indicated ranges for
small grants could range from £10,000­£100,000 with larger grants having a
maximum limit of £3,000,000.
● Flexibility towards grant size and value will be essential and grant value
should be balanced against administrative considerations.

Monitoring and evaluation
DCMS is keen to find effective methods of monitoring and evaluating of both the
Fund and the success of projects that both align with cultural heritage protection and
established development methodologies. In the consultation we asked for insight into
this area in order to identify best practice.
|​
Q7: In your experience what are the most effective ways of monitoring and
evaluating the success of projects, especially outcomes which may be
harder to capture?
The responses indicated that there was no consensus on how best to monitor and
evaluate both the Fund and projects but rather that a broad range of different
methodologies and techniques will be essential for evaluating and monitoring the
success of projects. Key considerations highlighted in the responses and in the
workshops which are informing the development of a monitoring and evaluation
strategy for the Fund include:
● There is a wealth of sectoral expertise and best practice which DCMS and the
British Council should draw upon.
● Monitoring and evaluation strategies should be defined early on in the design
process of the Fund.
● It is considered best practice for applicants to give consideration of monitoring
and evaluation in the application process.
14

● A mix of qualitative and quantitative methodologies is desirable.
● Evaluation will be reliant on establishing initial benchmarks.
● Monitoring and evaluation strategies should give consideration for long term
impact which will exceed the end of the project. Preventative projects whose
benefit is ‘negative’ (i.e. that it has stopped something happening) will be
particularly hard to measure.
● Success of projects will extend beyond the immediate measurable outcomes
of projects.

Proposed approach for the delivery of the Cultural Protection Fund
|​
Q8: Do you support our overall approach to the Cultural Protection Fund as
outlined in Section 2.1?
|​
Q8a: Please provide any further comments to support your answer to question 8.
The majority (77.8%) of respondents stated agreement with the overall approach
outlined in section two, 7.9% did not agree and 14.3% did not respond to this
question directly. While these results indicate strong support for the proposed
approach to the policy, there were some concerns raised relating to whether the full
range of expertise was held by both DCMS and the British Council to run the Fund.
This expertise will be incorporated into the Fund and further information on this can
be found at ​
Annex B​
.

Geographical focus and prioritisation
|​
Q9: Which regions or ODA­eligible countries do you think grant funding should
be targeted towards and would have the most benefit in the first year of the
Fund’s operation?
|​
Q10: Which regions or ODA­eligible countries do you think grant funding should
be targeted towards and would have the most benefit in the subsequent
years of the Fund’s operation?
Chart III: Geographical priorities raised for the first year of the Fund by % respondents.

For questions 9 and 10, respondents were
asked to consider the geographical
priorities of the Fund and consider our
stated intention to initially focus on the
MENA region.
Year 1 ­ Question 9
A quarter of participants did not answer
question 9. Less than 10% responded that
regional priority should not change
according to the years of the Fund and around 20% of respondents named other
regions specifically for intervention and the same amount did not express a regional
preference but did think that narrowing the scope of the Fund was important.
Almost half agreed that prioritising work in the MENA region, or one of its countries,
should be a priority for year one of the Fund and 28.4% noting that for work to take
place ​
only ​
in the MENA region was desirable. 16.4% outlining that work would be
desirable both within MENA and elsewhere. The most frequently cited countries in
need of intervention were Syria (22.2%), Iraq (17.5%), Egypt (12.7%), Libya (11.1%),
Lebanon (11.1%) and Yemen (9.5%).
16

Geographical priorities beyond the first year of the Fund ­ Question 10
Chart IV: Geographical priorities raised beyond the first year of the Fund by % respondents.

The picture looks quite different for those
who answered question 10, which sought
views on the priorities beyond the first
year. Approximately a third thought work
should take place within MENA but within
this only 15.9% considered that working
only​
in MENA was preferable.
Nearly half of the responses did not
specifically mention the MENA region and
a quarter either did not answer or did not
consider that there should be a specific priority, meaning that over two thirds thought
that work taking place should include regions other than MENA or did not have a
regional preference.
Other regional priorities
The MENA region as a whole and the countries within it were by far the most
frequently cited as being in need of immediate intervention. However, respondents
raised a range of other regional priorities for the Fund which spanned from the
inclusion of all endangered sites or prioritisation according to ranking in global
indices (such as the Global Peace Index) to specific regions and countries. Other
possibilities for geographical priorities which were raised in the workshops and
consultations are listed in Table V.

Key conclusions drawn from reviewing this information included:
● Having a narrowed focus for at least the first year is desirable.
● While it is clear that other regions and countries would benefit from additional
support, MENA was the region over which there was the most consensus for
the need to intervene at this time and is an appropriate priority for the first
year of the Fund.
17

● There is sufficient difference between the responses to questions 9 and 10, as
well as evidence gathered from other means of consultation, to suggest that
this regional prioritisation should be reviewed after the first year.
● A clearer definition of what is meant by the MENA region and work in ‘global
conflict zones’ is necessary. This is outlined in the ​

Security

Q11: ​
​
What are your views on the feasibility of working in potentially dangerous
areas? Please include any advice on how the Fund could support
interventions in these scenarios and examples of previous initiatives.
Chart V: Views on the feasibility of working in
high­risk areas by no. of respondents?

Given that the terms of funding will
require the Fund to work in global
conflict zones, security and duty of care
is and will continue to be a
consideration of paramount importance.
In answer to question 11, 15% thought
that this work should never take place
and just under half of participants
considered that it was feasible to carry
out work in conflict zones, though with
significant caveats and differing
opinions over when and how this should
take place. A fifth noted ways in which
this work could be done remotely.
Suggestions included working through local networks, working with affected
populations in areas outside of or bordering conflict zones, distance learning or by
carrying out remote sensing or data acquisition projects.
We are grateful to participants in the consultation period for their advice and
suggestions for how to carry out work relating to conflict zones, including in areas at
risk of conflict and how work can be done post­conflict as well as how to monitor and
mitigate risks. In accordance with the responses given to many of the questions, it
was clear that in matters of security and working in conflict flexibility, local knowledge
and engagement, networks and collaboration with relevant bodies was seen as key
to ensuring success as was consideration of these matters during the application
process. Table VI includes a summary of some of the key points raised.

Q12: Which issues relating to gender should we be aware of? Please make
reference to any specific examples that you would like us to consider.
|​
Q12a: How could this be monitored?
Approximately half of the participants did not express a view on the matter of having
regard to gender equality. 27% of participants raised that gender issues should be
considered in some form or another. Given that it is legally required to ensure regard
of gender issues when spending ODA, it is clear that work should be carried out to
ensure that this responsibility is communicated clearly to potential applicants.
From those who answered question 12a and others who took part in the workshops,
respondents did offer helpful advice regarding mitigation of gender issues which
included common problems, the need to be sensitive to local individual contexts,
suggestions for monitoring practices and the types of policies and protocols (see
table VII) which should be in place to ensure these issues are appropriately taken
into account. As with other considerations such as security, monitoring and
evaluation, having a long­term, locally sensitive approach which engages the
community was considered best practice, as was dealing with gender up front in the
application process.

Q13: Are there any other specific requirements or conditions that should be
19

applied to programmes applying for grant funding which you think we
should be aware of? Please make reference to any specific examples that
you would like us to consider.
Question 13 sought information on any other requirements or conditions relating to
matters such as equalities or specific legal duties. However, the question brought
about a range of answers covering multiple different aspects of grant funding. As
such we have ensured that the valuable information gathered here is incorporated in
other relevant sections of this response.

Additional findings and key themes
This section summarises the key themes that arose throughout the written
responses and in the workshops. Many of these themes were points of concern for
respondents and these considerations will inform many aspects of the Fund, both
strategic and operational.

Priorities of work for the Cultural Protection Fund
The consultation explained that the terms of the initial funding for the Cultural
Protection Fund was to support efforts to protect cultural heritage in ‘global conflict
zones’ across the three outcomes of​
Cultural Heritage Protection​
,​
Training and
Capacity Building​
and​
Advocacy and Education​
. The responses to the consultation
process have indicated that there is a need to define specific priorities for the Fund,
especially regarding the areas highlighted below.
Prevention vs. restoration: ​
A significant
number of responses made it clear that many
perceived the initial proposals for the Cultural
Protection Fund to lend a disproportionate
focus on restoration, particularly of
archaeological sites, contradicting the Fund’s
aim to ​
protect​
cultural heritage. This need for
protection was also echoed in the workshops.
In fact, approximately 40% of responses
emphasised the need to prioritise, in some
way, protective measures. In addition, a group
of participants (17.5%) highlighted the
possibility for work post­conflict such as
projects incorporating peacebuilding and
reconciliation efforts. Others noted that
moveable heritage should be covered under
the Fund, not just archaeological sites.

Scope of work for the Fund: ​
The
consultation set out the terms of the
initial funding for the Cultural
Protection Fund to support efforts to
protect affected cultural heritage in
‘global conflict zones’ but that there
was potential for this to open up to
work with cultural heritage affected
by natural disasters in the future​
.
Around a third of respondents
raised areas they felt should be at
least one additional priority for the
Fund, including natural disasters
(14), other environmental damage
(4), intangible heritage (14) and
several (5) stating a preference for
the Fund to work with all
endangered sites.

Key conclusions:
● Protective and preventative work​
is preferential and should be adequately
​
prioritised. Due diligence should be carried out to ensure that the Fund does
not disproportionately favour or exclude any particular type of cultural heritage.
● A significant part of the sector consider that intervention to protect cultural
heritage should extend beyond cultural heritage at risk from conflict and this
should be considered when formulating a long­term strategy for the Fund’s
aims.

21

ODA
Discussion with stakeholders at workshops and feedback from the sector has
indicated that this type of funding is unfamiliar and will require clear guidance to be
issued.

Expertise
Expertise was a key theme expressed by respondents in the consultation responses.
We did not ask a specific question on expertise, but 25% of respondents raised the
need for additional expertise for either or both the British Council and DCMS. Both
organisations were already aware of this need and consequently set a specific
question to stakeholders on expertise in the consultation workshops to see what
shape and scale this expertise might be needed to support the delivery of the Fund
and assess grant applications.
Key findings from the workshop
Breadth of expertise​
:A
range of expertise was
highlighted as essential
not only from across the
cultural heritage sector
but also from further
afield including: the
development sector and
understanding of the
wider development
context, foreign policy
expertise, country
specialists, military,
scientific expertise and
input from the local
communities. It was
generally recognised
that the British Council’s
ODA expertise and
international network
and experience would be
of great benefit to the
Fund.

Mechanisms to access expertise​
: Mechanisms to
enable access to expertise were explored in the
workshops. Many stakeholders referred to an advisory
board consisting of necessary expertise including
international, heritage and ODA or an expert pool to
support the Fund. Existing networks, panels or bodies
could be used for this purpose. The composition of the
panel/committee could be selective to applications or
rolling from a pool of experts. It was also noted that a
panel should include representation (or be able to seek
advice) from people from the affected countries to assess
issues. Many stakeholders also suggest a two pronged
approach to expertise, and that two distinct groups were
needed, assessors for projects and advisers ­ a pool of
experts. It was noted that there needed to be a balance of
expertise to enable effective decision making. There
should also be a balance between technical and
academic expertise. The workshops also led to the
conclusion that expertise should be demonstrated within
grant applications to ensure projects were supported by a
record of relevant expertise and experience.

22

Local expertise and community engagement
Community engagement and local expertise were strong themes throughout the
consultation. In fact, nearly 80% of written responses raised the need to include
this type of engagement and expertise. It is clear that ensuring projects are locally
appropriate and developed with and for local communities is essential to the
success of the Fund. This was articulated in various different ways in both the
workshops and the written responses. Desirable requirements raised by
respondents included:
● Clear benefits for the
community
● Local participation, resourcing
and procurement
● Desire to avoid an imperialistic
approach
● Security of local communities

● Incorporating local knowledge and
expertise (generally and relating to
specific issues)
● Bottom­up and localised collaboration,
partnerships and leadership
● Work with local authorities

Practical considerations
Both section two of the consultation document and the workshops sought views
from participants on more practical elements of the Cultural Protection Fund. Many
of these comments have been outlined and captured in the preceding sections to
this consultation. However, there were several key practical considerations which
are significant enough to highlight separately. It is clear that whilst strong support
exists for the Cultural Protection Fund, there is an equally strong desire for the
Fund to work carefully to ensure best practice. Key considerations raised included
timing, the application process and the need for a balance between best practice
and innovation.
Timing: ​
The time
period noted in the
consultation to
launch this fund
and begin projects
is extremely
ambitious and
consideration
should be given to
reviewing this
timescale and to
look at a different
model for the first
year’s projects.

Application process:
As indicated
throughout this
response, it is clear
that many examples of
best practice for grant
funding offered by
respondents are those
that seek key
information and
evidence up front in
the application
process.

Balance between best practice
and innovation: ​
As indicated
throughout this response, it was
clear that while the Cultural
Protection Fund was welcomed
overall, there was some
apprehension around the lack of
experience in this area, the security
and programme risk inherent in this
work as well as the lack of central
knowledge available not only to
government but to the sector as a
whole and what this might mean for
the Fund.

23

A long term strategic view for the Fund
One of the strongest themes to come out of the consultation period was the need for
the Fund to operate according to a long­term strategic view and make funding
choices according to this strategy. While respondents views about what exactly this
long­term view should comprise of, there was consensus over several areas.
Sustainability: ​
How the Fund and
associated projects will make a long­term
impact was a strong theme of both the
workshops and written responses (30%).
As previously indicated (p.14 and 15),
respondents felt that many markers of
success for projects would not be evident
immediately during or after project work.
However, comments around sustainability
extended beyond the need to simply
ensure that long­term benefits were
captured; it is clear that for many
participants ​
planning​
for this long­term
impact should be a crucial aspect of the
Fund design.

Information sharing: ​
While only a few
participants (5) specifically raised the
matter of information sharing for
projects in the written responses, the
question of whether appropriate
information about the Fund’s work
would be available was repeated
frequently at the workshop. Attendees
felt that it was important for
transparency and would contribute to
avoiding duplication of projects and
could contribute to the knowledge of
the sector.

Coordination:​
It has also been clear from the outset that there is a wider need to
take an expert and coordinated approach to the Cultural Protection Fund which
complements existing work. This is something we had aimed to address through the
proposed principles for the Fund and in raising the matter of coordination at the
workshops as a discussion topic where it was clear that the need for
complementarity and collaboration were important concerns for the sector.
Complementarity:​
There was no opposition against the assessment that
​
complementing existing cultural heritage initiatives was key; in fact significant
proportion of respondents strongly agreed. However, there were some nuances to
how respondents understood the matter of complementarity. Some drew on the need
for a central body to coordinate and others emphasised that collaboration and
engagement with relevant organisations and experts was a key means to ensure
complementarity. In addition, several respondents highlighted the need for projects
under the Fund to complement not only cultural heritage programmes but wider
social and economic and environmental programmes.
Collaboration:​
As discussed there is a strong desire in the sector for local and
​
community engagement amongst those who have taken part in this consultation
period as well as the need to engage. However, this desire for collaboration went
beyond the local. Many emphasised the need to work with international bodies such
as UNESCO and existing networks and bodies (governmental and
non­governmental), not only as a means to seek expertise and complementarity but
to potentially assist with delivery.
24

Key conclusions:
● Projects should be funded as part of a coordinated strategy which has a
long­term, sustainable focus and strategy and ensures complementarity. The
existing knowledge base will need to be built upon in order to meet this aim.
● Given the development focus of the Funding, specific consideration should be
given as to how these programmes complement wider regional initiatives.
● It is desirable to look at appropriate means of information sharing.
