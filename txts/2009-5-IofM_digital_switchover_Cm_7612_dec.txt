CHAPTER 2: MAKING AND DETERMINING
APPLICATIONS
11.
(1)

Persons who may apply
An application for assistance may be made by–
(a) the person seeking assistance, or (where that person is a child) the adult who receives
child benefit for him and who lives at the same address; or
(b) any person appearing to the Administrator to be authorised (whether generally, such
as under a Power of Attorney, or specifically, such as by a letter of authority signed
by a member of the household) to make such an application on behalf of the person
seeking assistance.

(2)

References in this Scheme to “an applicant” are to the person making an application
for assistance, whether they fall within sub-paragraph (a) or sub-paragraph (b) of
paragraph (1).

12.

When and how applications are to be made
(1) Assistance is available in the Borders region for a limited period only, and accordingly,
applications for assistance will not be duly made unless made ­
(a) during the applicable period of availability for the Borders region,
(b) in respect of an eligible person whose home is located on the Isle of Man,

and in all other respects is made in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
(2)

Applications for assistance may be made–
(a) in writing to the Administrator;
(b) by telephone to a call centre designated for the purpose by the Administrator;
(c) to an e-mail address specified by the Administrator for the purpose;
(d) via a website maintained by the Administrator for the purpose; or
(e) by any other means which the Administrator may permit either generally or on a
case-by-case basis.

(3)

Every such application must be accompanied by, or as the case may be, subsequently
supported by, such evidence in relation to any criterion of eligibility that is relevant to the
application as the Administrator may reasonably require (whether in general or in relation
to a particular application).

13.
(1)

e-Communications
The Administrator may notify a person of any matter by e-mail or SMS text message
if, but only if, that person has expressly notified the Administrator that he agrees to
communications from the Administrator being sent to him in that manner.

7

426943_Cm 7612.indd 7

13/5/09 09:51:18

(2)

The Administrator is not to be regarded as having received any application or other
communication directed to him by telephone, e-mail or SMS text message unless that
communication has been directed to him at a telephone number or e-mail address specified
by him (whether generally or to a particular person) as one at which he is prepared to
accept such communications.

14.
(1)

Determination of applications
As soon as practicable after receiving an application for assistance, the Administrator
must either–
(a) accept the application as having been duly made in accordance with this Scheme
(and clauses 11 and 12 in particular); or
(b) decline to accept the application and notify the applicant of that fact, giving the
reasons why the application cannot be accepted and explaining the steps (if any) that
can be taken to make the application acceptable.

(2)

Subject to paragraph (3), where an application has been duly made in accordance with this
Scheme the Administrator must notify the applicant in accordance with clause 15(1) and
(2) in relation to an application that has been duly made within the time scale specified in
the Code of Service Standards made under clause 27.

(3)

Where, in the course of determining an application for assistance, it appears to the
Administrator that the application cannot be determined without further steps being taken
by the applicant (such as the provision of additional information or such evidence as may
be duly required under paragraph 12(3)) the Administrator shall notify the applicant of
that fact and of the steps that need to be taken to enable the determination to proceed.

(4)

As soon as reasonably practicable after determining an application, the Administrator
must notify the applicant–
(a) that he (or, as the case may be, the person on whose behalf the application was made)
is not an eligible person, giving his reasons for that decision, or
(b) that he (or, as the case may be, the person on whose behalf the application was made)
is an eligible person,

and in either case the notification must provide information about the Scheme’s Internal Review
procedure and how to apply for an Internal Review of the Administrator’s determination.
15.
(1)

Notification
A notification under clause 14(4)(b) shall also specify–
(a) the types of assistance which the eligible person is to be offered in accordance with
clause 17;
(b) whether the eligible person is entitled to that assistance free of charge as provided in
clause 16(1);
(c) if the eligible person is not entitled to the assistance free of charge, the specified
charge and the arrangements for paying it as mentioned in clause 16(2).

8

426943_Cm 7612.indd 8

13/5/09 09:51:18

(2)

Where an eligible person has received a notification under paragraph 14(4)(b) the
Administrator must allow him a period of 14 days in which he may notify the Administrator
that he does not want to proceed with his application for assistance; and the Administrator
must not proceed with the application if he receives such notification.

(3)

In cases where an eligible person dies after the Administrator has issued a notification to
him under clause 14 (4)(b):
(a) the claim will continue in the name of his surviving partner or child if that surviving
partner or child is himself an eligible person living at the same address and (for this
purpose) any change in entitlement to income support or income-based jobseeker’s
allowance which occurs as a consequence of the death shall be disregarded;
(b) if the eligible person’s surviving partner or child living at the same address is not
an eligible person, at the choice of that surviving partner or child, the Administrator
must either continue to provide assistance or refund any charge paid; or
(c) if the eligible person is not survived by a partner or child living at the same address
the Administrator is not required to continue to provide assistance where the deceased
eligible person was entitled to receive such assistance free of charge and shall refund
to the estate of the deceased eligible person or to the person who made it any sum
paid in respect of the specified charge for that eligible person’s claim.

16.
(1)

Entitlement to free or paid-for assistance
An eligible person is entitled to receive assistance free of charge if–
(a) he (or, as the case may be, a person acting on his behalf as mentioned in clause 11(1))
makes an application for assistance; and
(b) at the relevant time (within the meaning given in clause 8)–
(i) the eligible person,
(ii) his partner, or
(iii) if the eligible person is a child, the relevant adult,

is in receipt of income support or income-based jobseeker’s allowance.
(2)

An eligible person who is not entitled to receive assistance free of charge is entitled to
receive assistance in return for payment of the specified charge if–
(a) he (or, as the case may be, a person acting on his behalf as mentioned in clause 11(1))
makes an application for assistance; and
(b) the specified charge for that assistance has been paid.

(3)

In paragraph (2), references to the specified charge having been paid are references to
that charge having been paid in such manner and to such person as may be specified by
the Administrator; and the Administrator must ensure that there is a range of methods for
paying the charge suitable for use by eligible persons (but such methods need not include
payment by instalments).

9

13/5/09 09:51:18

(4)

In paragraph (1)(b)(iii), in relation to an eligible person who is a child, “the relevant adult”
means the adult who appears to the Administrator, according to information provided
by a public provider of information, to live at the same address as that child and who is
either–
(a) the adult who receives child benefit for that child, or that adult’s partner; or
(b) an adult who appears to the Administrator otherwise to be responsible for that child.

CHAPTER 3: ASSISTANCE UNDER THE SCHEME
17.
(1)

Types of assistance available
The types of assistance to be provided to an eligible person shall be determined in
accordance with this clause, but subject to clauses 18 and 19.

(2)

It is for the Administrator to–
(a) determine in accordance with Schedule 4 which type of assistance from those
described in paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 3 will in his opinion constitute the most
cost effective option of assistance which can be provided to eligible persons in the
Borders region;
(b) determine whether any upgrade equipment may be offered to eligible persons
choosing the most cost effective option of assistance in the Borders region, and the
additional payment required for such equipment;
(c) determine in accordance with Schedule 5 whether any alternative assistance as
described in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 is to be made available to eligible persons
in the Borders region; and
(d) subsequently, notify the applicant (pursuant to clause 15(1)) of the assistance which
can be offered to the eligible person.

(3)

The Administrator’s notification must–
(a) offer assistance determined in accordance with paragraph (2)(a);
(b) provide information about–
(i) any upgrade equipment; and the level of the additional payment payable by
the eligible person for the provision of that equipment (as determined for the
purposes of paragraph (2)(b)), if chosen by the applicant; and
(ii) the operation of the upper limit and the circumstances in which a review of the
most cost effective option of assistance for the eligible person may occur; and

(ii) the appropriate payment which will be made to an alternative provider of that
assistance, if chosen by the applicant.
(4)

In this clause–
(a) “the additional payment”–
(i) is the amount by which the cost to the provider of the most cost effective option
of assistance of providing the upgrade equipment chosen by the applicant (as
determined in accordance with that paragraph) exceeds that of providing the
equipment included in the most cost effective option of assistance for eligible
persons in the Borders region, as determined in accordance with paragraph (2)
(a); and
(ii) does not include a reference to any sum payable by virtue of regulations made
under section 364 of the Communications Act 2003 (TV licence fees).

assistance described in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Main Scheme as are to be
made available to that person;
(c) “alternative provider”, means a provider of assistance comprising television services
described in paragraph 2(2)(b) of that Schedule;
(d) “the appropriate payment” means a payment made by the Administrator to an
alternative provider, following a referral of an eligible person to that provider by way

him by a public provider of information as being–
(a) a person whose home is located on the Isle of Man and potentially eligible for help
under the Scheme, or
(b) a person who from the information so provided appears to be authorised to act on
behalf of such a person,

paragraph (1) is contacted more than three times unless (whether in response to such a
letter or otherwise) the person in question has made a claim for assistance under the
Scheme or has otherwise solicited further communications.

(3)

This clause does not apply in relation to any person who is not identified by the Administrator
(whether by using information provided by a public provider of information or otherwise)
as being contactable at a particular postal address.

30.
(1)

Other obligations of the Administrator
The Administrator must do all that he can to secure that–
(a) persons receiving help under the Scheme do not suffer any break in the continuity
of their reception of television programme services as a result of a failure by the
Administrator to carry out his obligations;

under the Scheme involving contact with members of the public are appropriately
trained to work with the classes of persons whom the Scheme is intended to help and
the persons who may care for them;
(c) no person is so engaged at a time when he is barred from activities involving
children or vulnerable adults; and
(d) he deals sensitively with cases where the person entitled to help dies after his or her
claim has been determined.

(c) the Isle of Man Government.

CHAPTER 3: RELATIONS WITH OTHER BODIES
32.
(1)

Services other than those provided by the Administrator itself

of digital television services or equipment for the provision of such services or equipment
to eligible persons (as defined in clause 18) (other than where the Administrator secures

eligible persons).

(2)

Any such arrangements must be on terms that are–
(a) fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory; and
(b) (without prejudice to paragraph (a)) broadly the same, as between the different
services or equipment other than services or equipment directly supplied by the
Administrator.

(3)

The Secretary of State shall appoint, or arrange for the appointment of, an adjudicator to

Digital UK
The Administrator must make arrangements for the co-ordination and (where appropriate)
integration of Digital UK’s generic communications with other communications connected

equipment in drawing up generic communications; and
(c) agreeing with Digital UK a budget for their role under these arrangements, and the
manner in which payments are to be made to Digital UK for that purpose.

In this clause, “generic communications” means any communications that are not
specifically directed to a particular individual in connection with that individual’s
entitlement (or otherwise) to help under the Scheme and the provision of such help, and
includes any activities aimed at raising awareness of the Scheme, such as–
(a) design of generic communications and developing tools for targeting eligible
groups;
(b) advertising and public relations campaigns (conducted through any medium); and

communications.

(4) But generic communications do not (in particular) include–

complied with in the handling of such information for the purposes of the Scheme.
(2)

Where, for reasons beyond its reasonable control, such information is unobtainable or
unavailable, the BBC will be relieved of its obligation in clause 2(2) to provide assistance
under this Scheme to the extent to which it is no longer possible for it to do so.

(3)

The use of data supplied by DWP or DHSS for purposes other than a function of the
Scheme is not permitted.

35. Provision of Information
The Administrator must, if so requested by DWP or DHSS, make arrangements for supplying
information about the operation of the Scheme to DWP or DHSS, their agencies, and the Veterans
Agency and comply with any Memorandum of Understanding as may be agreed between DSHS
Ltd and the public providers of information.
36.
(1)

Charitable and other not-for-profit organisations
The Administrator must make such arrangements, as it considers appropriate for the
provision of further help to those who have received help under the Scheme, and for
providing funding for the implementation of such arrangements.

(2)

Those arrangements should, so far as possible, be made with charitable and not-for
profit organisations.

37. Suspension of Scheme
(1) The provisions of this Scheme are conditional on no decision or judgement being made by
a competent body in relation to any provision of the EC Treaty or legislation based upon
the EC Treaty (“EC law”) in respect of the Scheme which has the direct or indirect effect
of preventing or obstructing the operation or funding of the Scheme. If any such decision
or judgement is made or threatened by a competent body, the Secretary of State may
suspend the continued operation of the Scheme until such time as suitable arrangements
have been made or suitable steps have been taken so as to allow the implementation of the
Scheme to continue without being prevented or obstructed by the decision or judgement
made or threatened under EC Law.

SCHEDULES TO THE MAIN HELP SCHEME
APPLICABLE TO THE ISLE OF MAN DIGITAL HELP
SCHEME
SCHEDULE 1: EXPENDITURE, FINANCING AND
BORROWING
1.
(1)

Costs of the Scheme
The costs of the Scheme (including its overheads, financing, administrative and marketing/
communication costs) estimated at £603 million in nominal terms over the lifetime of the
licence fee settlement (from 2007/8 to 2012/13), will be ring-fenced. These funds must
only be used to pay for the Scheme; the BBC will not be required to contribute any more
than that amount from its public service and other resources if the licence fee is not
increased beyond the “base case” settlement (under which the licence fee would be uprated by 3/3/2/2/2/0% between 2007/8 and 2012/13).

(2)

In the event that there is a cost overrun above £603m, this will not be at the expense of
the BBC’s programmes, services or other resources. The precise mechanism for achieving
this, should the need arise or be anticipated, will be determined at the appropriate time.

(3)

Similarly, if Scheme expenditure is less than the estimated budget of £603m, decisions
on how this underspend is dealt with will be taken nearer the time that any underspend
becomes apparent, possibly in the context of the next licence fee period.

2.
Borrowing Limits
The BBC Trust undertakes that the BBC will not plan to have more than £150m borrowing
outstanding against its £200m limit for non Scheme-related borrowing, and will only do so in
exceptional circumstances determined at the sole discretion of the BBC Trust. The Trust will
plan for all borrowing undertaken under the said borrowing limit to be reduced to broadly zero
by the end of 2012/13.
3.
Financial Arrangements
The Secretary of State has agreed with the BBC Trust that the £603m estimated cost of the
Scheme will be divided into annual amounts to be set aside from the licence fee for the purpose
of funding the Scheme. In nominal terms, these sums are as follows:
2007/08
£12.6 m
4.
(1)

2008/09
£67.6 m

2009/10
£129.6 m

2010/11
£159.0 m

2011/12
£160.7 m

2012/13
£73.5 m

Extensions to Borrowing
In accordance with the terms set out in sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), the Government will
consider any request for an increase in the additional borrowing limit of £25m (permitted
for the Scheme), in any year in which the Trust expects total spending (including overheads
and financing costs) on the Scheme to exceed the agreed provision made (including any
provision which may be available from any previous underspends against the agreed
provision) by more than the borrowing capacity which is otherwise available.
27

426943_Cm 7612.indd 27

13/5/09 09:51:18

(2)

Where the Trust’s expectation, supported by evidence, is that the total spend over the
settlement period will remain within the ring-fence of £603m, the Government will expect
to accede to any request, subject to sub-paragraph (4).

(3)

Where the Trust’s expectation, supported by evidence, is that the total spend over the
settlement period will be in excess of the ring-fence of £603m, the Government will
expect to accede to any request, subject to sub-paragraph (4) and to considering:
(a) alternative ways of meeting expenditure above the agreed profile, without reducing
the funding available for the BBC’s programmes and services or reducing its other
resources; and/or
(b) measures to reduce the expected cost of the Scheme in order to maintain expenditure
within the ring-fence limit. The Government will agree with the Trust the impact of
any such measures on the costs of the Scheme.

(4)

The Government will otherwise only refuse a request in exceptional circumstances related
to the fiscal or macroeconomic position, unrelated to the BBC’s position, in which case it
will give the Trust its reasons for doing so.

(5)

The Government will complete its consideration of all requests from the BBC within 28
days of receipt.

5.
Reporting Obligations
The BBC Trust will report annually on how it has complied with its obligations in relation to
the Scheme. The Trust will ensure that the Scheme is operated in a way which provides value
for money on behalf of licence fee payers and will discuss with the National Audit Office
arrangements for reviewing the value for money of the operation of the Scheme.
6.
Suspension of Financial and Operational support for the Scheme
If it appears to the Trust that funding for the Scheme can no longer be provided within the
conditions set out in paragraphs 1 to 5 above, and continued funding would thus put at risk the
BBC’s programmes, services or other resources, the Trust may suspend financial and operational
support for the Scheme until those conditions can be met thereby avoiding that risk. The costs of
any suspension will be met from the provision set aside for the Scheme described in paragraph
3 of this Schedule. The Trust will give the Government its reasons for suspension.

SCHEDULE 2: GOVERNANCE AND
ACCOUNTABILITY
SECTION A: STRUCTURES

to them in their capacity as members of the Project Board, according to this Schedule (see
below).

(5)

The BBC Trust will set out in a written instrument–
(a) the Project Board’s remit (subject to sub-paragraph (6));
(b) details as to the manner in which the Project Board is to fulfil its remit; and
(c) particulars of the occasions on which the Project Board is to make reports to the
Trust, of the occasions on which or circumstances in which the Trust may require
such reports, and of the matters to be contained in any such report.

(6)

The remit of the Project Board includes the functions contained in Part 3 of this Scheme,
and must also include–
(a) advising the BBC on the selection of one or more contractors to operate the Scheme;
and

for money is achieved.

(7)

The Project Board may invite the Administrator to report to or be represented (or both) at
its meetings.

(8)

The Project Board must from time to time consult the Consumer Expert Group about
matters relating to the Project Board’s remit, and (in addition) hold a joint meeting with
that Group at least twice a year.

(9)

The role of any person appointed to serve in any capacity as part of the Project Board
may be undertaken by that person’s duly-appointed alternate; and any defect in the
appointment of any such person (or alternate) shall not affect the validity of the Project

13/5/09 09:51:18

2.
(1)

The Policy Review Group
A group to be known as the Policy Review Group will meet regularly; and its remit will
be as set out below.

(2)

The Policy Review Group will be chaired by DCMS and its membership will consist of
one member appointed by each of the following, that is to say–
(a) DCMS;
(b) the BBC Trust;
(c) the Executive Board of the BBC;
(d) DWP; and
(e) Digital UK.

(3)

The Policy Review Group may also invite–
(a) any other person to attend any of its meetings;
(b) any other organisation to appoint a person to be a member of the Group.

(4)

The principal function of the Policy Review Group is to discuss policy matters relating
to this Scheme, and in particular those that may call for changes to this Scheme (whether
those matters are raised by the Group itself or are referred to the Group by the Project
Board).

(5)

If any question arises as to whether consideration of a matter is for the Project Board
rather than the Policy Review Group, or vice versa, that question shall be determined by
the BBC Trust.

(6)

Any matter referred to the Policy Review Group by the Project Board will be discussed
by the Group as soon as reasonably practicable, having regard to the nature and urgency
of the matter in question.

(7)

The Project Board will send a representative to every meeting of the Policy Review Group;
and that Group will at every meeting receive a report from the Project Board as to the
operation of the Scheme in the period since the last report.

(8)

The Policy Review Group must from time to time consult the Consumer Expert Group
about matters relating to the Scheme that fall within the Policy Review Group’s remit.

(9)

The role of any person appointed to serve in any capacity as part of the Policy Review
Group may be undertaken by that person’s duly-appointed alternate; and any defect in the
appointment of any such person (or alternate) shall not affect the validity of the Policy
Review Group’s proceedings.

13/5/09 09:51:19

3.
(1)

Decision-making and change management
If, in the case of any matter discussed by the Policy Review Group, the Group considers
that it would be desirable to make a change to the Scheme, that matter must be referred
to the BBC and DCMS for decision (because no such change can be made without their
agreement); and in the absence of such a decision within a reasonable time, the Group
may take it that the proposed change has been rejected.

(2)

If the proposed change to the Scheme appears to involve–
(a) an increase in the costs of the Scheme (whether or not above the total estimated cost,
or agreed annual profile, set out in Schedule 1), or
(b) a significant practical or legal impact on the operation of the Scheme, or both,
the Group must not refer the matter to the BBC and DCMS for decision unless it has first
received a report under sub-paragraph (3).

(3)

A report under this sub-paragraph is a report approved by the BBC Trust which–
(a) sets out the costs of the change or (as the case may be) its practical or legal impact,
or both, and

(b) indicates whether or not the change can be implemented and operated within the total
estimated cost, or agreed expenditure profile, set out in Schedule 1;
(and in the case of a change that cannot be implemented and operated within that total
estimated cost or agreed expenditure profile, the matter will fall to be dealt with according
to the provisions of Schedule 1).
(4)

Any other matter discussed by the Policy Review Group will be dealt with in a manner
appropriate to its subject-matter and having regard, in particular, to the extent of any
authority delegated to members of the Group by the organisation that appointed them.

4.
(1)

Changes to the Scheme by the Secretary of State
If the condition referred to in sub-paragraph (2) is satisfied, the Secretary of State may
amend the Scheme in such a way as she considers necessary to ensure that the Scheme
complies with competition law and the law governing State Aids, but only after complying
with the provisions of this paragraph.

(2)

The condition is that the Secretary of State considers there is a risk that the Scheme does
not comply with competition law or the law governing State Aids (owing to developments
in the law, new legal advice or otherwise).

(3)

Before making any amendments to the Scheme under this paragraph, the Secretary of
State must–
(a) request a report on the changes she proposes from the BBC (which report must be
approved by the BBC Trust), and a report on those changes from the Policy Review
Group; and

31

426943_Cm 7612.indd 31

13/5/09 09:51:19

(b) provided any such reports are received by her within a reasonable time, take them
into account in determining what amendments to the Scheme are necessary and
appropriate.
(4)

A report referred to in sub-paragraph (3) may:
(a) include information or opinion as to the likely costs of the proposed changes or (as
the case may be) their practical or legal impact, or both;
(b) indicate whether or not, in the opinion of the author of the report, the changes could
be implemented and operated within the total estimated cost, or agreed expenditure
profile, set out in Schedule 1.

(5)

If a report approved by the BBC Trust and received by the Secretary of State under this
paragraph includes any opinion, supported by evidence, to the effect that the proposed
changes to the Scheme would require action in accordance with paragraphs 1(2) or 4(1)
of Schedule 1, the Secretary of State must, as soon as practicable after receiving the
report, make proposals in writing to the BBC Trust as to what action she thinks would be
appropriate.

SECTION B: ACCOUNTABILITY
5.
(1)

Value for money
The BBC Trust is responsible for holding the BBC Executive Board to account for ensuring
that value for money is achieved in the operation of the Scheme.

(2)

The BBC Trust will (in particular)–
(a) determine performance indicators;
(b) determine how it will measure the performance of the Administrator against those
indicators; and
(c) ensure that the Scheme is operated in a way that will provide value for money for
licence fee payers.

6.
The BBC Trust’s annual progress report
The BBC Trust’s annual report on digital switchover (which it must produce pursuant to clause
41 of the Agreement) must contain information about the operation of the Scheme, including
(in particular) information about performance indicators mentioned in paragraph 5 and the
performance of the Administrator.
7.
(1)

Accounts of the Scheme
The BBC will prepare annually a statement of accounts for the Scheme which sets out the
expenditure incurred by the BBC under this agreement.

(2)

The Trust will require the statement of expenditure to be examined and certified by an
external auditor.

13/5/09 09:51:19

8.
(1)

Reports by the Project Board to the Trust
Each month, the Project Board must produce and send to the Trust a report on the operation
of the Scheme and the costs that the operation of the Scheme has incurred in the period
since the last report was produced.

(2)

The Trust may also ask the Project Board to produce and send to the Trust a report on
any aspect of the operation of the Scheme and the costs of that aspect of the Scheme that
may be specified in the request. The Trust may make such a request whenever the Trust
considers it reasonable to do so, and the Project Board must comply with that request.

(3)

A report under this paragraph must contain such information or comment as the Trust
may reasonably require, including (if so required) the Project Board’s observations on
whether value for money has been achieved during the period covered by the report or (as
the case may require) in relation to any particular aspect of the operation of the Scheme.

The most cost effective option of assistance will in all cases comply with the Code of
Service Standards as published in accordance with clause 28 of the Scheme and will
consist of–
(a) the provision of equipment chosen by the applicant from that offered by the
Administrator, being equipment that will enable the eligible person to receive the

426943_Cm 7612.indd 33

13/5/09 09:51:19

(b) the provision of equipment chosen by the applicant from that offered by the
Administrator, which will enable the eligible person to receive the public service
television channels at his home by means of a free-to-view service (other than freeto-view digital terrestrial television); or
(c) the provision of equipment chosen by the applicant from that communicated by the
Administrator and offered by another provider of free-to-view services, which will
enable the eligible person to receive the public service television channels at his
home by means of a free-to-view service.
(2)

Alternative assistance may consist of–
(a) the provision of equipment as described in sub-paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) where such
assistance has not been determined by the Administrator, in accordance with clause
17(2)(a), as the most cost effective option of assistance; or
(b) an offer to refer the eligible person to an alternative provider of–
(i) other free-to-view services (if any) that are available to him; or
(ii) pay-TV services (if any ) that are available to him;
where the assistance provided by those providers will enable the eligible person to
receive the public service television channels at his home and, so far as reasonably
possible, comply with the Code of Service Standards as published in accordance
with clause 28 of the Scheme.

(3)

Assistance under sub-paragraph (1) must include, and that under sub-paragraph (2) may

not mentioned above, as the Administrator may specify in a notification given under
clause 17(2)(d).

3.
(1)

Provisions supplemental to paragraph 2
The requirement imposed on the providers of the most cost effective option of assistance by
sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 2 and clause 17(3)(a) to offer equipment is not to be taken
to require the those providers to offer more than one model of each type of equipment,
where any equipment’s “type” is defined by reference to its general functionality, but not
its specific capabilities.

34

426943_Cm 7612.indd 34

13/5/09 09:51:19

(2)

In paragraph 2, “free-to-view”, in relation to any means of transmitting television
programme services in digital form, is a reference to a means of transmitting such services
that is not a pay-TV service.

(3)

In paragraph 2, “pay-TV service” means any service (including satellite or cable television
and any other means of distributing television programme services)–
(a) by which a person may receive television programme services; but
(b) in relation to which–
(i) a subscription or other recurring payment is, or will be in the future, required as
a condition of receiving one or more channels in intelligible form; or
(ii) some positive action is required to be taken by a person now or in the future in
order to prevent such further charges from being incurred; and
(c) which either provides reception of the public service television channels as part of
the service, or provides equipment which allows the reception of those channels in
addition to any channel for which a payment is required.

(4)

In paragraph 2, in relation to an eligible person, “the relevant ITV region” means the ITV
region in which that person’s home is located, as determined by the Administrator under
clause 10.

(5)

Where an eligible person is offered assistance under clause 15(1) which includes assistance
of a type under paragraph 2(2)(b), the Administrator–
(a) must contribute either–
(i) the value of the appropriate payment (as defined in clause 17(5) and calculated
in accordance with paragraph 5), towards the alternative provider’s cost of
providing that assistance, or
(ii) if less, the full cost to the alternative provider of that assistance; and
(b) is not responsible for meeting any charges due to the alternative provider beyond
making the payment mentioned in sub-paragraph (a).

4.
(1)

Long term residential accommodation
This paragraph applies in a case where–
(a) the eligible person’s home is in long-term residential accommodation within a
building with common areas maintained through the payment of service charges, or
(b) it appears to the Administrator that the eligible person is not responsible for, or does
not or cannot consent to, the installation or maintenance of an external aerial or
satellite dish.

(2)

In a case to which this paragraph applies–

13/5/09 09:51:19

(b) may offer assistance under sub-paragraph (3)(c), or sub-paragraph (4), of that
paragraph.
5.
(1)

Payments to be made to alternative providers (including pay-TV services)
Where an eligible person (or a person acting on his behalf as mentioned in clause 11(1))
chooses to receive digital television by means of a service provided by an alternative
provider, the Administrator is not responsible for meeting any charges due to the alternative
provider of that service beyond the payment he is obliged to make mentioned in sub­
paragraph (2).

(2)

The Secretary of State–
(a) shall appoint a suitable expert who shall set, and from time to time review, the criteria
to be applied by the Administrator in respect of calculating the appropriate payment
to be made to the alternative providers of assistance to eligible persons entitled to
help under the Scheme in a particular ITV region; and
(b) may, from time to time, notify the suitable expert of any principles which are to be
taken into account when setting the criteria in sub-paragraph (2)(a).

(3)

The principles notified to the expert appointed under sub-paragraph (2) must (in particular)
secure that the appropriate payment set by the Administrator for a particular ITV region
is an amount considered by him to be equal to the estimated average cost of providing the
most cost effective option of assistance to eligible persons in that ITV region.

(4)

The expert appointed under sub-paragraph (2) must approve–
(a) the level of payments to be made by the Administrator to the alternative providers of
assistance in a particular ITV region in accordance with sub-paragraph (3); and
(b) the level of the upper limit as defined in clause 17(5).

SCHEDULE 4: CALCULATION OF THE MOST COST
EFFECTIVE OPTION OF ASSISTANCE
1.

Considerations relating to the most cost effective option of assistance under the
Scheme
In determining for the purposes of clause 17(2)(a) the most cost effective option of assistance
for eligible persons in a particular ITV region, the Administrator shall pay particular regard to
the following–
(a) the most cost effective option of assistance for eligible persons in a particular ITV
region must be offered to all eligible persons in that ITV region capable of receiving
reception of the public service television channels through that means following
digital switchover in that ITV region;

36

426943_Cm 7612.indd 36

13/5/09 09:51:19

(b) where it appears, from the predicted or actual availability of the public service
television channels after digital switchover in that ITV region, that (for technical
reasons only) the most cost effective option of assistance is unable to provide reception
of the public service television channels to all eligible persons in that ITV region
after switchover, the Administrator may determine which other assistance constitutes
the most cost effective option of assistance for those other eligible persons so that
(for technical reasons only) the Administrator is capable of offering one most cost
effective option of assistance to each eligible person in that ITV region;
(c) that acceptance of a most cost effective option should not be dependent upon the
acceptance by (or on behalf of) an eligible person of goods or services other than
goods or services necessary for the reception of the public service television channels
by means of that option.
2.
(1)

(2)

Duties on the Administrator in calculating the most cost effective option of
assistance
In carrying out the calculation for determining what constitutes the most cost effective
option of assistance, the Administrator must first calculate the cost to the Administrator of
providing those types of assistance as mentioned in paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 3 which are
to be offered directly by the Administrator to eligible persons in a particular ITV region,
based upon the addresses of eligible persons, taking into account information provided by
the BBC, Digital UK, Ofcom and any other person appearing to the Administrator to have
relevant information.
In making this calculation, the Administrator shall–
(a) exclude from the calculation any common Scheme costs (start-up, initial mailings,
marketing); and
(b) include all other relevant costs, including but not limited to equipment, site visits,
aerial supply, installation costs and the Administrator’s estimate of the net present
value of the cost to the Administrator and the eligible person of using each of the
forms of assistance over a period of 5 years from the date of installation.

(3)

Subsequent to making the calculation in sub-paragraph (1) the Administrator must use
reasonable endeavours to seek information from providers about such types of assistance
mentioned in paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 3 as are likely to be available to eligible persons
in a particular ITV region; including quotations of the full cost, over a period of 5 years
from the date of installation, of providing that assistance.

(4)

Having received the information in sub-paragraph (3), and before the date specified by or
in accordance with sub-paragraph (5), the Administrator must make its assessment as to
the type of assistance that constitutes the most cost effective option of assistance in that
ITV region.

(5)

The date mentioned in sub-paragraph (4) is either–
(a) the last day before the commencement of the applicable period of availability in that
ITV region, as defined in clause 8(4), or
(b) such other date as may be notified to the Administrator by the Project Board in
relation to that particular ITV region.

13/5/09 09:51:19

3.

Powers available to the Administrator in calculating the most cost effective option of
assistance
The Administrator may review its determination as to what type of assistance constitutes the
most cost effective option of assistance to eligible persons in a particular ITV region where, in
the opinion of the Administrator, it is reasonable to do so.

SCHEDULE 5: AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE
ASSISTANCE
1.
Duties on the Administrator in determining alternative assistance
In determining for the purposes of clause 17(2)(c), the alternative assistance to be made available
to eligible persons in a particular ITV region, the Administrator shall use reasonable endeavours
to seek information relating to the provision of assistance by alternative providers as mentioned
in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 as is likely to be available to eligible persons in a particular
ITV region.
2.
Alternative assistance to be made available
Having received the information in paragraph 1 and before the commencement of the applicable
period of availability in each ITV region, as defined in clause 8(4), the Administrator must
determine what alternative assistance will be made available in that ITV region.
3.
Powers available to the Administrator in determining alternative assistance
The Administrator may review its determination as to what alternative assistance will be made
available to eligible persons in a particular ITV region where, in the opinion of the Administrator,
it is reasonable to do so.
