Ms. Sophie Marment
TV Licence Enforcement Review
BBC Policy Team
Department of Culture, Media and Sport
100 Parliament Street, London, SW1A 2BQ
Dear Sophie
Isle of Man Government Response to Consultation on TV Licence Enforcement (“Perry
Review”)
The Isle of Man Government is grateful to have been invited to respond to the review of the
enforcement of the TV licence fee.
Following consideration, the Isle of Man’s Council of Ministers has agreed that it is supportive of the
decriminalisation of non-payment of the TV licence fee.
However, the Council of Ministers also agreed that any change to the current enforcement approach
should not increase the enforcement costs/burden for any part of the Isle of Man Government and
the enforcement regime should also minimise the financial impact and inconvenience for consumers
to the extent possible and be clearly explained to all stakeholders.
The Isle of Man Government would wish to be kept informed about any next steps and impact
assessments concerning the enforcement options, as well as the final decision and implementation
plan.
Yours sincerely

Anne Shimmin
External Relations Manager
